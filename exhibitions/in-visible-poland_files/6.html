  <strong>In-Visible: Abstractions and Narratives</strong></p>
<p class="style3">Galeria Arsenal<br>
  Bialystok, Poland<br>
September 10 - October 17, 1999</p>
<p class="style3">Wojciech Lazarczyk, Robert Maciejuk and Odili Donald
    Odita are abstract painters -- although Odita also works in other media --
    whose meticulously crafted art refract a number of cultural traditions or
    situations: Eastern European; Western European; American; African. While
    sharing the designation of "abstract" and
  certain formal similarities, their divergences are even more arresting, reflecting
  how problematized, or at least extended, current definitions of abstractions
  can be, how plural identities have become, how reversible and contingent.</p>
<p class="style3">Robert Maciejuk plants his geometric configurations at
    the intersection of the non-objective, the abstract and the representational,
    details he extrapolates from idealized Renaissance cityscapes and Uccello's
    obsessive studies of perspective, from road and railway signs and corporate
    logos, like the BMW insignia. He strips them down, cleans them up, divesting
    them of accumulated narratives and cultural signification. At the same time,
    Maciejuk acknowledges the perceptual complexity of these images, their fluidity,
    their multiple meanings, the simultaneity of their existence as pure abstraction
    and as representations, as signs of high modernism and pop art; as icons
    in the service of capitalist materialism and utopian aestheticism. Odili
    Donald Odita, a Nigerian-born artist who has lived most of his life in the
    United States, also posits multiplicity and simultaneity, weighting his serrated
    fields of interlocked triangles with aesthetic and extra-aesthetic baggage.
    His honed, flattened shapes, activated by the flash of their scissoring diagonals
    which cross the width of the pictorial surface, are part of the vernacular
  of Western modernism but also refer to African-inspired motifs with their insistent
  linearity, dissonant colorations, abrupt, syncopated rhythms, and non-centralized
  composition where emphasis is displaced to the peripheries. As Odita manipulates
  increasingly raveled, increasingly equivocal cultural boundaries, what he touches
  upon is the nature of difference, the protocols of cultural precedence and
  hegemony, the guises of cultural imperialism, the complexities of identity.
  Whose geometry is it? Like Maciejuk, Odita amplifies the density of readings.
  Wojciech Lazarczyk, on the other hand, seems at first glance, the most classic
  abstractionist of the group, but even his velvety textured, richly hued canvases
  are not merely color field or monochromatic painting but also emblematic of
  that genre of painting, inflected though the history of Eastern--specifically
  Polish--and Western European modernism as well as through American non-objective
  art, for instance, Rothko, Reinhardt, Ryman. Lazarczyk's "pure" paintings
  are what they appear to be but they are not only that; their significance is
  as layered as their facture and situated within a larger context of reductivism.
  In a more oblique manner than the others, his elegantly reticent paintings
  critique notions of originality and authenticity, of continuity and disjunction
  within a received, a historiated idiom.<br>
  <br>
    To reconfigure parameters, to undo and contest temporal constraints and certainties,
    to increase the amount of information absorbed, to overthrow equilibrium,
    to extend the discourse and assert identity is one series of aspirations;
    abstract paintings, viewed from this vantage point, as metaphor or rhetoric,
    represent much more than they actually depict. On another, more literal level,
    however, these are also just paintings, representing only themselves in all
    their material, idiosyncratic and particular splendour. Wojciech Lazarczyk,
    Robert Maciejuk and Odili Donald Odita depend on both to present their respective
    cases persuasively, to offer what are ultimately the public consequences
    of private desires with intelligence, grandness and generosity.</p>
