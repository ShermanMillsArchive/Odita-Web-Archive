The  Anderson Gallery, Virginia Commonwealth University's Museum of the 
Arts, will  present works by 11 internationally acclaimed artists this 
fall in the  exhibition Surface Charge. Organized by the New York-based 
curators Sabine Russ  and Gregory Volk, the exhibition will be on view 
from September 23 through  December 4, 2005.
<p>A standard  museum practice is to import art works in order to 
display them on the walls or  on the floor; Surface Charge aims to 
thoroughly alter this practice. Works in  Surface Charge will be created
 directly on and with the walls of the Anderson  Gallery, turning its 
very surfaces into active forces, as opposed to neutral  supports. A 
variety of techniques will be used, and most of the works will  exist 
only for the duration of the exhibition.</p>
<p>Ragna Robertsdottir (Iceland) will apply thousands of lava chips from
 a volcano in  Iceland directly to the wall, while Karin Sander 
(Germany) will sand and polish  a section of wall, turning it into a 
shimmering, highly reflective field. Odili  Donald Odita (Nigeria/U.S.) 
will compose abstract paintings on the walls, and  Elana Herzog (U.S.) 
will staple and sew textiles into the wall. Lawrence Weiner  (U.S.), 
long one of the main figures associated with Conceptual Art, will apply 
 enigmatic phrases to the wall, while Karina Peisajovich (Argentina) 
will create  a light and painting installation that responds to the 
specifics of the space.  Kim Schoenstadt (U.S.) will both draw on and 
cut into the wall to create a  large, architecturally inflected work 
while Katrin Sigurdardottir (Iceland)  will present three sculptures 
that conflate walls, abstract forms, and  Icelandic landscape imagery. 
Surface Charge will include a riveting video by  Maix Mayer (Germany) 
involving empty walls in a newly built museum in Leipzig.  Lisa Sigal 
(U.S.) will create a three-dimensional painting installation with  
elements on, and springing from, the walls. Completing the exhibition 
will be a  sprawling wall collage of textile and felt silhouettes by 
Sally Smart  (Australia) replete with references to Australian culture 
and the artist's  personal life. </p>
