<p>Odili Donald Odita: FLOW</p>
<p>November 10 – Fall 2008</p>
<p>In early October 2007, Odili Donald Odita began a month-long 
transformation of Kaplan Hall, the lobby of the Lois &amp; Richard 
Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art designed by acclaimed architect 
Zaha Hadid. Odita named the resulting site-specific wall painting FLOW. 
“Coming into the space, I felt very energized by the design and the 
architecture,” Odita says. “What I responded to in the space was the 
energy of being inside and outside at the same time.” </p>
<p>Odita spent several days with his sketchbook, observing the space at 
different times of day, the shapes and angles of the architecture, the 
movement of pedestrians and passing cars, and the presence of 
neighboring buildings. From his initial pencil sketches, Odita’s 
black-and-white designs were transferred to the walls using chalk lines 
to mark out the shapes. He then assigned colors leading to a final 
palette of 112, a unique color combination for each wall. Realized with 
his full-time assistant Emily Erb and a crew of ten artists, FLOW 
gradually emerged through a laborious process of repeated taping and 
painting, each shard of color receiving multiple layers of standard 
acrylic house paint.</p>
<p>Odita’s angular bands create vivid abstractions that simultaneously 
suggest landscapes and African textiles, a reference to his birthplace 
in Nigeria. What other associations may visitors make as they follow 
FLOW as it seemingly wraps its way around the lobby’s large walls or 
dazzles visitors descending to the lower lobby? A young kindergarten 
student, observing the installation in progress, said it reminded her of
 friendship. When asked what she meant, the student said “like a 
friendship bracelet.” The woven strands of that childhood gift form an 
immediate comparison with the interweaving shapes that are a visual 
signature of Odili’s paintings.</p>
<p>Free of any fixed point of perspective, FLOW offers visitors nearly 
endless angles from which to consider the work and its relationship to 
Hadid’s architecture. FLOW encourages visitors to move through Kaplan 
Hall in search of dramatically different vistas: from the staircase 
leading to Level 2, across the open lobby from the CAC Store, or between
 the facing walls with their bold starburst patterns. FLOW also propels 
vision outward, creating a heightened awareness of the intersecting 
movements of pedestrians and vehicles. The work is equally compelling 
when viewed from outside with two of the best vantage points looking 
north from the skywalk over Walnut Street and looking west along Sixth 
Street. Indeed, a portion of FLOW faces Walnut Street and is only 
visible from outside.</p>
<p>FLOW dissolves the distinction between inside and outside, asserting 
Kaplan Hall’s role as the community space that Hadid envisioned—the 
urban carpet that transforms the interior lobby into a public square—and
 suggesting the communal activity implied in Odita’s references to 
African textiles and wall painting. Discussing his Nigerian ancestry, 
Odita states “[m]y paintings are often called internal geographies…In a 
sense they are my internalization of Africa and the landscape space that
 I was born in but haven’t lived in a large part of my life.” </p>
<p>On view for a full year, FLOW will seemingly change with the seasons,
 its colors responding to the oblique sunlight and gray of winter, while
 the subtler earth tones will resonate across the lengthening days of 
spring and summer.  Especially vibrant at night when reflections in the 
glass multiply its scale, FLOW extends across the street in beautiful 
counterpoint to artist Julian Stanczak’s monumental work of public art 
across Sixth Street. </p>
<p>FLOW was curated by Raphaela Platow, CAC’s Alice &amp; Harris Weston 
Director and Chief Curator, with Maiza Hixson, Curatorial Assistant.</p>
