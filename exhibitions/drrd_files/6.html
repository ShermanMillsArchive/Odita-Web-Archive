<p>Bye-bye, Babar<br>
  (or: What is an Afropolitan?)</p>
<p>It’s moments to midnight on Thursday night at Medicine Bar in London.
 Zak, boy-genius DJ, is spinning a Fela Kuti remix. The little 
downstairs dancefloor swells with smiling, sweating men and women fusing
 hip-hop dance moves with a funky sort of djembe. The women show off 
enormous afros, tiny t-shirts, gaps in teeth; the men those incredible 
torsos unique to and common on African coastlines. The whole scene 
speaks of the Cultural Hybrid: kente cloth worn over low-waisted jeans; 
African Lady over Ludacris bass lines; London meets Lagos meets Durban 
meets Dakar. Even the DJ is an ethnic fusion: Nigerian and Romanian; 
fair, fearless leader; bobbing his head as the crowd reacts to a sample 
of Sweet Mother.</p>
<p>Were you to ask any of these beautiful, brown-skinned people that 
basic question   “where are you from?”  you’d get no single answer from a
 single smiling dancer. This one lives in London but was raised in 
Toronto and born in Accra; that one works in Lagos but grew up in 
Houston, Texas. 'Home' for them is many things: where their parents are 
from; where they go for vacation; where they went to school; where they 
see old friends; where they live (or live this year). Like so many 
African young people working and living in cities around the globe, they
 belong to no single geography, but feel at home in many.</p>
<p>They (read: we) are Afropolitans  the newest generation of African 
emigrants  coming soon or collected already at a law firm/chem lab/jazz 
lounge near you. You’ll know us when you see us by our funny blend of 
London fashion, New York jargon, African ethics, and academic successes.
 Some of us are ethnic mixes, e.g. Ghanaian/Jamaican, Nigerian/Swiss; 
others are merely cultural mutts: American accent, European affect, 
African ethos. Most of us are multilingual: in addition to English and a
 Romantic or two, we understand some indigenous language(s) and speak a 
few urban vernaculars. There is at least one place on the Continent to 
which we tie our sense of self: be it a nation-state (Ethiopia), a city 
(Ibadan), or simply an Auntie’s kitchen. Then there's the G8 city or two
 (or three) that we know like the backs of our hands, and the 
institutions (corporate, academic, etc.) that know us for our work 
ethic. We are Afropolitans: not citizens, but Africans of the world.</p>
<p>It isn't hard to trace our genealogy. Starting in the '60's, the 
young, gifted and broke left Africa in pursuit of higher education and 
happiness abroad. A study done in 1999 estimated that between 1960 and 
1975 about 27,000 highly skilled Africans left the Continent for the 
West. Between 1975 and 1984, the number shot to 40,000 and then doubled 
again by 1987, representing about 30% of Africa's highly skilled 
manpower. The most popular destinations for these emigrants included 
Canada, Britain, and the United States; but Cold War politics produced 
unlikely scholarship opportunities in Eastern Bloc countries like 
Poland, as well. Some three decades later this scattered tribe of 
pharmacists, physicists, physicians (and the odd polygamist) has set up 
camp around the globe. </p>
<p>The caricatures are familiar. The Nigerian physics professor with 
faux-Coogi sweater; the Kenyan marathonist with long legs and rolled 
r's; the heavyset Gambian braiding hair in a house that smells of burnt 
Kanekalon. Even those unacquainted with synthetic extensions can conjure
 an image of the African immigrant with only the slightest pop cultural 
prompting:  Eddie Murphy’s "Hello, Babar". But somewhere between the 
1988 release of Coming to America and the 2001 crowning of a Nigerian 
Miss World, the general image of young Africans in the West transmorphed
 from goofy to gorgeous. Leaving off the painful question of cultural 
condescension in that beloved film, one wonders what happened in the 
years between Prince Akeem and Queen Agbani? </p>
<p>One answer is: adolescence. The Africans that left Africa between 
1960 and 1975 had children, and most overseas. Some of us were bred on 
African shores then shipped to the West for higher education; others 
born in much colder climates and sent home for cultural 
re-indoctrination. Either way, we spent the 1980's chasing after 
accolades, eating fufu at family parties, and listening to adults argue 
politics. By the turn of the century (the recent one), we were matching 
our parents in number of degrees, and/or achieving things our 'people' 
in the grand sense only dreamed of. This new demographic  dispersed 
across places like Brixton, Bethesda, Boston, Berlin  has come of age in
 the 21st century, redefining what it means to be African. Where our 
parents sought safety in traditional professions like doctoring, 
lawyering, banking, engineering, we are branching into fields like 
media, politics, music, venture capital, design. </p>
<p>Nor are we shy about expressing our African influences (such as they 
are) in our work. Artists like Keziah Jones, Trace founder/editor Claude
 Gruzintsky, architect David Adjaye, and novelist Chimamanda Achidie 
exemplify what Gruzintsky calls the "21st century African." What 
distinguishes this lot and its like (in the West and at home) is a 
willingness to complicate Africa  namely, to engage with, critique, and 
celebrate the parts of Africa that mean most to them. Perhaps what most 
typifies the Afropolitan consciousness is this refusal to oversimplify; 
the effort to understand what is ailing in Africa alongside the desire 
to honor what is uniquely wonderful. Rather than essentialising the 
geographical entity, we seek to comprehend its cultural complexity; to 
honor its intellectual and spiritual legacies; to sustain our parents' 
values.</p>
<p>For us, being African must mean something. The media's portrayals 
(war, hunger) won't do. Neither will the New World trope of bumbling, 
blue-black doctor. Most of us grew up well aware of being from a 
blighted place, of having last names linked to countries linked, in 
turn, to corruption. Few of us escaped those nasty "booty-scratcher" 
epithets, and fewer still that sense of shame when visiting paternal 
villages. Whether we were ashamed of ourselves for not being more 
familiar with our parents' culture, or ashamed of that culture for not 
being more "advanced," can be unclear. What is manifest is the extent to
 which the modern adolescent African is tasked to forge a sense of self 
from wildly disparate sources. You'd never know it looking at those 
dapper lawyers in global firms, but most were once supremely 
self-conscious of being so “in between”. Brown-skinned without a bedrock
 sense of blackness on the one hand, and chided by family members for 
acting white on the other  young immigrants can get what I call "lost in
 transnation.” </p>
<p>Ultimately, the Afropolitan must form an identity along three 
dimensions: national, racial, cultural   with subtle tensions in 
between. While our parents can claim single countries as home, we must 
define our relationship to the places we live; how British or American 
we are (or act) is in part a matter of affect. Often unconsciously, and 
over time, we choose which bits of a national identity (from passport to
 pronunciation) we internalize as central to our personalities. So, too,
 the way we see our race  whether black or biracial or none of the above
   is a question of politics, rather than pigment; not all of us claim 
to be black. Often this relates to the way we were raised, whether 
proximate to other brown people (e.g. black Americans) or removed. 
Finally, how we conceive of race will accord with where we locate 
ourselves in the history that produced 'blackness,' and the political 
processes that continue to shape it.</p>
<p>Then there is that deep abyss of Culture, ill-defined at best. One 
must decide what comprises "African culture" beyond filial piety and 
pepper soup. The project can be utterly baffling   whether one lives in 
an African country or not. But the process is enriching, in that it 
expands one's basic perspective on nation and selfhood. If nothing else,
 the Afropolitan knows that nothing is neatly black or white; that to 
'be' anything is a matter of being sure of who you are uniquely. To 'be'
 Nigerian is to belong to a passionate nation; to be Yoruba, to be heir 
to a spiritual depth; to be American, to ascribe to a cultural breadth; 
to be British, to hold the passport. That is, this is what it means for 
me   and that is the Afropolitan privilege. The acceptance of complexity
 common to most African cultures is not lost on her prodigals. Without 
that intrinsically multi-dimensional thinking, we could not make sense 
of ourselves. </p>
<p>And if it all sounds a little self-congratulatory, a little 
"aren't-we-the-coolest-damn-people-on-earth?"   I say: yes it is, 
necessarily. It is high time the African stood up. There is nothing 
perfect in this formulation; for all our Adjayes and Achidies, there is a
 brain drain back home. Most Afropolitans could serve Africa better in 
Africa than at Medicine Bar on Thursdays. To be fair, a fair number of 
African professionals are returning; and there is consciousness among 
the ones who remain, an acute awareness among this brood of 
too-cool-for-schools that there's work to be done. There are those among
 us who wonder to the point of weeping: where next, Africa? When will 
the scattered tribes return? When will the talent repatriate? What 
lifestyles await young professionals at home? How to invest in Africa's 
future? The prospects can seem grim at times. The answers aren't 
forthcoming. But if there was ever a group who could figure it out, it 
is this one, unafraid of the questions. </p>
