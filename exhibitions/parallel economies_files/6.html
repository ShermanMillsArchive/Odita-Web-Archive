<p>WERTZ CONTEMPORARY</p>
<p>PARALLEL ECONOMIES</p>

<p>A catalogue on CD will be available with essays by Franklin  Sirmans, Gean Moreno and Odili Donald Odita </p>
<p>This  exhibition took shape through a series of conversations between
 most of the  artists involved on the ways in which artworks can 
negotiate a way to point to  the social without falling into literalist 
political proposals. For decades  aesthetic discourse has relied 
heavily, on the one hand, on formal readings  and, on the other, on very
 straightforward, content-bound interpretation. The  interest here is to
 explore ways in which cultural objects can be located in  the world 
through complex negotiations between material, pattern, encoding and  
form. One way found by these artists to place an object in a broad 
social,  cultural, and geopolitical context has been to employ 
disobedient structures  and forms that refuse the limitations of formal 
readings, and yet do not  present the bulk of their meaning at the 
representational/content level. Flea  market stalls and shanties are, 
for instance, disobedient structures in  relation to the geometries of 
Modern architecture. And disobedient not only in  their physical 
geometry, for these makeshift structures violate all sorts of  
conceptual organizational principles as well as convey disregard for the
  form-function divide; they also register as socio-economic by their 
very  nature, which makes allowance for these structures to exist beyond
 a rigid and  encapsulating conceptual critique.
</p>
<p>The works  gathered in this exhibition are disobedient structures in 
various ways.  Physically, in that they bend and stretch their 
respective mediums (e.g.,  Radcliffe Bailey's combine paintings, Danilo 
Duenas assembled  "paintings"). Conceptually, in that they usually draw 
from multiple  fields of references (i.e., Odili Odita's stripe 
paintings draw from modernist  painting, African textiles, landscape and
 digital efforts, while also point to  his identity and work out a bit 
of an institutional critique). Formally, in  that they refuse the 
"purity" of form that underscores so much  formalist thinking, and 
instead encode social situations in the structures and  materials 
employed (e.g., Sol Sax's linguistic sculptures, Carl Pope's  vernacular
 posters). There is also a particular disobedience in the way  materials
 are used. While a lot of this work employs refuse and cheap trinkets,  
the thrust here seems to be less a quest for a poetics of the mundane 
and the  raggedy (arte povera) than a bit of commentary of economic 
disparities.</p>
<p>Ultimately,  the goal of the exhibition is to present an alternative 
line of thinking,  whereby objects are located in the world without 
falling back onto literal, and  reductionist processes. Through the use 
of very specific and carefully chosen  forms and materials, the artists 
in this exhibition place their work within the  socio-economic space 
from which it stems, giving it a critical dimension.</p>
