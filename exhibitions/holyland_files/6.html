<p>"Breaking Ground: Diaspora's Current Shifts from the Body to Geography"</p>
<p>"I live today in neither in this world nor the last, neither in 
America nor Astrakhan. Also I would add neither in this world nor the 
next. A woman like me, she lives someplace in between. Between the 
memories and the daily stuff.1</p>
<p>The "Other" is the subject borne from nineteenth century colonialism 
who today continues to play a vital role within society as the subject 
who possesses no membership within it. Falling into the cracks between 
nations, ideas, economies and citizenship, his identity survives because
 his questionable status of citizenship is indispensable to the 
self-realization of Eurocentrism and dominant ruling forces. Over the 
last fifty years, as the world has become smaller through 
transnationalism and globalization, the "Other" has not died but has 
been reinforced as economic systems have strengthened throughout the 
world whether in the far East or on United States soil.</p>
<p>The twenty-first century is the first moment that the identity of the
 "Other" has been able to take steps beyond the grips of capitalism, 
colonialism and Modernism. "At the conclusion of the Cold War, human 
rights have become linked to world trade and to the diversity of 
capitalism."2 Methodologies have become interdisciplinary while national
 borders have gained in flexibility due to technology. Where subjugation
 always broadens in an expanding world, so do ideas and opportunities. 
As alternative modes of thinking and living become more widely visible, 
there is a possibility for ideas to extend beyond Modernist tropes.</p>
<p>Fredric Jameson in his recent book "Archaelogies of the Future: The 
Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions" re-examines the history
 of Utopia as understood throughout Modernity. For the sake of brevity 
here, Utopia is the idealistic alternative construct to Western dominant
 powers for the last two hundred years. Jameson sheds light on the dark 
economic corners of globalization and how crucial aspects of Modernism 
and its descendent ideas and methodologies are weak from the ground up 
because of unstable ideological structures integral to Utopian 
philosophies. Like the "Other," Utopia was a concept that came to life 
as an equal and necessary alternative to the dominant forms of 
governments in the west.</p>
<p>Jameson asserts that globalization is "...the consolidation of the 
world market..." and that culture, a given insertion into any global 
economic transaction, is fraught with ideological blind spots for which 
"...Utopian politics (or of any political Utopianism)..." is responsible
 for supplying the foundations of its belief systems.3 Thus, Jameson 
re-examines ideas of the identity of the "Other," to make both a 
critique of the influential Utopia in critical cultural thinking as well
 as to point out that an alternative to the social imaginary of Utopia 
has already been at work in popular culture through the imaginary of 
science fiction.</p>
<p>Resting on the popular assumption that fantasy and imagination are 
merely notions of the whimsy or flighty, imaginative daydreaming 
maintains strict boundaries that are hyper- or hypo-flexible. It is 
always gauged by the needs and desires of he who is dreaming. Desire is a
 natural force that never requires a disciplinarian to fully realize 
itself.</p>
<p>"...humans remain the prisoners of an anthropomorphic philosophical 
system...in imagining ourselves to be attempting contact with the 
radical Other, we are in reality merely looking in a mirror and 
searching for an ideal image of our own world." 4</p>
<p>Within the different "Other," Jameson asserts, is not an entity 
separate from the person looking at him but a reflection of that person.
 A man can only relate to other man-like things whether in the physical 
universe or here, more simply, on planet Earth where human beings are 
also stamped and relegated as Aliens and/or other worldly within social 
parameters. The ideal and usefulness of the "Other" is typically 
relegated to celebratory, performative or an aesthetically revolutionary
 cultural discourse that is typically disregarded as having any kind of 
agency other than its value as entertainment.</p>
<p>In 1903, W.E.B. DuBois was one of the first to link the subject of 
the "Other" to a unified global body under the rubric of the Black 
Diaspora. In his seminal book "The Souls of Black Folk," DuBois links 
Black peoples throughout the world under the single physical 
characteristic of skin color. This facet of identity becomes the 
signifier that communicates across national and economic borders to 
connect people and their cultural similarities through simple visual 
recognition. DuBois' proposition of the Black Diaspora is still a 
template referred to today by compromised peoples throughout the world 
to peoples of various race and color. In the eighties and nineties, 
Diaspora and identity theory rigorously use the human body as the site 
of harm and healing in society. The early twenty first century, however,
 has shifted Diaspora and identity studies overwhelmingly to view the 
geography of actual land masses as sites in which to discuss identity 
politics and Diaspora.</p>
<p>The "Holy Land" exhibit uses the metaphorical desert to present the 
wilderness as a site that remains permanently untouched by human hands 
due to its tough environment, but also as a place where, when 
resourcefulness is used, life can exist. Shifting the Diaspora 
discussion of identity from the site of the body to landscape makes room
 for the flexibility of fantasy in a landscapes setting where personal 
desires are the starting point. Ideas become fluid moving from anywhere 
into anything guided by individual will. Boundaries begin to flex with a
 single desire.</p>
<p>The artists of this exhibit and many others like them, culture 
workers and theorists (like Jameson) show, there is a frustration with 
the lack of methodologies that seek options outside of Eurocentric 
thinking. People have begun to explore in the wildernesses, using 
metaphors, physical boundaries and fantasy to exist beyond civilization.</p>
<p>Metaphors "...as the etymology of the word suggests, transfers the 
domain of home and belonging across the middle passage; or the central 
European steppes, across these distances and cultural differences that 
span the imagined community of the nation-people."5 Metaphor and fantasy
 become the engine in the mind of the artist, the culture worker and/or 
the person physically moving between or through nations. Physical 
characteristics and their cultural givens are no longer the only 
invisible passports of recognition between migrant, displaced peoples. 
Those subjects who fall outside of a cultural mainstream recognize 
shared circumstantial experiences, ideas and dreams at all levels of 
society.</p>
<p>"...the language of modernity reveals a politics without duration, as
 (theorist)Louis Althusser once wrote: 'Spaces without places, time 
without duration" aptly expresses the movement of diaspora through 
today's imaginary.6 Thus, today's diaspora is a worldwide recognition 
that has expanded its prime focus from physical characteristics to ideas
 borne of circumstance and experience.</p>
<p>Land and space, whether imagined or real, indicates the agency that 
comes with ownership whether it be of sanity or property. What is holy 
has become personal space and time that may be discovered and explored 
in a safe realm. Every artist in this exhibit approaches Diaspora with 
an open ended tool of fantasy whether it be through abstraction or 
memory or both. They are breaking ground with an urgency that 
accompanies the search for relief.</p>
