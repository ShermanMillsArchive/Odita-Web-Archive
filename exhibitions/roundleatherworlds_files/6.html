<p>“Forever People”</p>
<p>By Gean Moreno</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odili  Donald Odita’s paintings are 
sites of contagion, territories where codes infect  one another. A 
Nolandesque color band cross-fades into a strip of African  textile; a 
fractal field becomes a desert landscape; the patterned skin of a  
soccer ball morphs into a chart of skin hues. This occurs at other 
levels as  well: geometry doubles as a site where cultural identity is 
marked; the trope  of self-referentiality is occupied by geopolitical 
narratives. For Odili,  painting doesn’t exist independent from the 
particular contexts—economic,  social, political, and cultural—from 
which it arises. And these contexts always  register in the work. So 
rather than run interference on this process of  registration, Odili 
opens the channels for it by treating painting as a space  where 
multiple discursive lines always overlap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporating  the visual motif of the
 soccer ball, Odili recognizes the African body through  a series of 
metaphorical deployments of color as skin, skin as landscape, and  
landscape as the connective tissue between bodies enduring the struggles
 at  home and bodies enduring displacement and Diaspora. Odili’s powder 
pigments,  applied directly to the wall, read as the epidermal pigments 
that have  accumulated so much meaning in our televisual economies of 
information  distribution. A black body—whether speeding down the 
sidelines, celebrating a  goal, or running down a city street, embroiled
 in a more ambiguous and sinister  scenario—is a social body, always 
emitting a series of predetermined signals,  even as it challenges the 
obstacles that channel interpretation. Relying on  soccer’s redemptive 
narratives, Odili negotiates a space in which the  complicated exchange 
between the inner dimensions and the imposed narratives of  the African 
body is teased out into the open.</p>
