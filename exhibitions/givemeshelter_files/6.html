<p>The Burden of Painting<br>
  Olu Oguibe</p>
<p>Among the central Igbo of West Africa, a legend survives of a mythic 
painter named Asele, master of the body and mural painting art of Uli, 
who was so good and astute in her art that she trounced her 
contemporaries in the land of the living and went on to repeat her feat 
in the land of the spirits, whereupon she was retained as a painter to 
the gods. Among the living her legend passed into myth, and her name was
 revered and celebrated in poetry and song. She was placed on a pedestal
 in lore and the popular imagination that is normally reserved for 
great, war commanders, legendary wrestlers, and poets. Generations of 
painters looked to her like to a patron saint embodying the ultimate 
attributes of the consummate artist.</p>
<p>Asele, in turn, may have acquired her extraordinary skill as a 
painter from the foremost artist of all, the divine painter Ala, goddess
 of the earth, art, and moral rectitude, who introduced painting into 
the world when she lovingly decorated the body of her devout messenger, 
the python, and turned him into a living work of art.</p>
<p>After her accomplishments in the land of the living, Asele proceeds 
to the land of spirits to compete with the finest of painters in that 
realm. We are left in no doubts as to the importance of painting. In the
 broad scheme of the universe, painting and the painter are acknowledged
 and canonized, and the significance of image making is inscribed as 
both embellishment and compliment to divine creation.</p>
<p>Ala, the goddess and grand patron of all arts, is not only a painter 
herself but an indulgent aesthete who seeks obeisance not in blood or 
with burnt offerings, but demands that her devotees tender instead an 
offering of beauty; an elaborate gallery of images and lavish 
decorations known as Mbari. Every so often as a community prospers and 
finds reason to show its gratitude to the divine painter and the gods, 
it engages the most renowned artists within its means and bids them 
erect a gallery in the goddess's honor, wherein Ala is depicted in all 
her splendor surrounded by her children and consort, Amadioha, deity of 
thunder and the heavens, as well as the entire pantheon of divinities 
and their messengers, attendants, and cronies. Each figure is 
elaborately attired and decorated, and this divine company is set 
against a background of colorful, abstract murals with metal and mirror 
insets.</p>
<p>The Igbo divine painter chooses body decoration as the first act of 
painting, with the aim to elicit the same pleasurable response as did 
the Hebrew god who, at the end of each day of his week of creation, 
looked back at his handiwork, and "saw that it was good."</p>
<p>The myth of Asele has yet another relevance for the contemporary 
African painter whose theatre of practice is the West. As noted earlier,
 it speaks to the desirability of transit and transcendence across 
borders and realms of origin. It is a potent and inspiring metaphor for 
the aspiring painter who is able through mastery of her art to levitate 
herself unto new planes and theatres of practice. Through mastery of her
 art Asele transported herself to the theatre of the spirits. Her 
ability to engage such unfamiliar territory, which is in many respects 
reminiscent of what I have described elsewhere as "the terrain of 
difficulty," and command it with enough redoubt to earn the commission of
 the gods, speaks to artists who come to the heart of the global from 
"elsewhere."</p>
<p>As we look again at the myth, it does appear that the burden of 
painting in all its forms and predilections is to compliment divine 
creation, and to provide that to which we might look and say, it is very
 good. That burden is light and bearable. </p>
