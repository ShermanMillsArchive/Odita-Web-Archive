<p> "Ordering and Seduction" is the title of the forthcoming 
comprehensive exhibition project at Haus Konstruktiv&nbsp; This  
international group exhibition centers on the thesis that the last few 
years  have seen a new visual interest, especially among a younger 
generation of  artists, in clarity, reduction and systematics. This 
decampment toward a  transferal of personal experiential values as they 
were tested internationally,  primarily in the 1990s, into the 
reducibility of exemplary valid structures,  expands and enriches our 
perspective on Concrete and Constructive Art.</p>
<p>On the  fourth floor we will create a cabinet situation with the four most historically  important Zurich Concrete artists -</p>
<p>Max Bill, Richard Paul Lohse, Verena Loewensberg and  Camille Graeser</p>
<p>that is to be read in context with the exhibition,  "Ordering and 
Seduction," as both a contextual subtext (as a type of  binding 
cue-giver), and as an acknowledgment of the internationally renowned  
importance of an enduring validity for these stances.&nbsp; The 
comparative confrontation of their  universal design approach with the 
pictorial and work orders of contemporary  artists -</p>

<p>reveals many formal references as well as shifts of  content. They 
are conceptions that are precise, yet charge the cool stringency  of the
 early concrete artists with a more optional moment. They are  
compressions, structurings and reductions in which the relevance of this
  internationally conducted discourse is exemplarily reflected.</p>
