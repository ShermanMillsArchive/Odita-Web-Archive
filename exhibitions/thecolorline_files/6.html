<p>THE COLOR LINE</p>
<p>In The Color Line, my main point of investigation is the 
relationships these selected artists have in their line of aesthetic 
inquiry with Africa and its Diaspora, as well as with intellectual 
notions of black, white and color as formats utilized to signify race 
and culture.  Furthermore, I want to look into the psychological 
condition of color as separate from, and in relation to the 
philosophical condition of black and white. This is not an exhibition 
about formalism in contemporary art, on the contrary, this is an 
exhibition about the specific, complex and rich ideas these artists are 
investigating within their individual practices that have a direct or 
remote relation to Africa. And in turn, I want to consider the complex 
conditions of African identity within a global context.</p>
<p> BLACK &amp; WHITE</p>
<p>The term, 'Black and White,' is normally understood as a basic 
pragmatic idea of clarity within thought, reasoning, and presentation.  
Black and white is also seen as an absolute in terms of value judgment. 
 I want this exhibition to investigate this pretense and research in a 
deep way the metaphoric conditions black and white has within the human 
consciousness.  I want to look into aspects of desire/desiring in 
relation to black and white.  And I want to look into notions of 'the 
missing' (obviously color), and speak about this absences identifiable 
within these spaces.  On a psychological level black and white will be 
examined here as a repository for the unfathomable, the unquenched and 
the unfinished.  I want to address the tension of this incompleteness 
found in this type of pictorial space where the viewer fills in and 
becomes the void that exists between the polar extremes of black and 
white.</p>
<p>The Color Line will also look into the ever-persistent problematic 
condition of black and white as it deals with race, and what manifests 
as a continued imbalanced state of power between these two absolute 
value positions.  This project will utilize the production of the 
exhibiting artist working in black and white to bring some insight into 
this aesthetic/socio-cultural problem.</p>
<p> COLOR</p>
<p>The premise of color here is one of description.  Color fills in the 
blank that is left open within a black and white format.  Color 
describes the world in a more complex, if obvious way, and yet the 
specificity of color can make this newfound complexity that much more 
alluring and mysterious.  Questions become even greater in a world of 
color as there seems to be more to see, and more to choose.</p>
<p>The issue of color also becomes interestingly rich when the 
intellectual notion of aesthetics with culture merge in its wake.  
Aesthetic concerns adapt themselves quite well within a culture frame, 
as they qualify through narrative means the distinct character of 
particular histories and societal lines.  The reaffirmation of these 
distinctions within a self can bring outward an understand of the 
complexity of relations that weave together varying human experiences.  
The Color Line will look into the manifestations of culture as it comes 
to color.  As previously stated, color in its descriptive state will 
also make reference to race in particular, as well as to culture and the
 aesthetic.  This condition of multiplicity has always been inherent 
within color; it is now in these contemporary times that we can be freer
 to discuss these multiplicities without an impinging 
ideological/aesthetic censoring.</p>
<p> METHOD</p>
<p>The relevance of this and other curatorial projects that I have 
executed is the direct approach I take as an artist who curates with 
collaboration and partnership in mind.  In the 21st Century, it is 
reassuring to understand that the role of the artist has become 
multivalent in ways that now allow us to write, curate, and hold 
positions of power over our own art production and careers.  The artist 
today has the power and the potential to make their position ring clear 
within a global and societal context.  In this way, the artist can be 
better equipped to challenge standards of cultural presentation within 
an art market structure.  It is also imperative that we are able to find
 new ways to move ourselves forward and face the continued challenges 
involved in growth, success and survival as a community.  The acceptance
 and responsibility of self-power is just a first step.  In this 
exhibition it will be seen that we can present our voices together as 
contemporary artists without the acrimony of an extremely divisive 
market place.</p>
