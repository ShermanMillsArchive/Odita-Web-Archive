<p>Odili Donald Odita </p>
<p>EQUALIZER </p>
<p>TThis site-specific mural inaugurates the new Project Space at The 
Studio Museum in Harlem. Equalizer, by artist Odili Donald Odita (b. 
1966), tells of two moments of migration from the African continent to 
the Americas. The first is the transatlantic slave trade, of the early 
1500s to almost 1900, which remains the largest forced migration in 
world history. The second, and more recent, is the contemporary 
relocation and emigration of Africans in search of political and 
economic stability. </p>
<p>Though abstract and without discernable figures or direct narrative 
references, Equalizer is what Odita calls a "conceptual journey" in 
which the interactions of shape and color become metaphors for land and 
sea, movement and settling, challenges and hope. The explosive image on 
the red wall illustrates movement out of Africa. The adjacent wall to 
the right, strong blues and mauve predominates, representing the 
Atlantic ocean which Odita describes as "all tooth and treachery." The 
next wall, where faint pastels blend to form somber gray tones that then
 give way to bright, prismatic earth tones on the right, represents 
potential and possibility. On the final wall, the patterns move from 
more horizontal orientation to smaller, animated fractals that are a 
metaphor for both the difficulties of immigrant life and the possibility
 that the African "migr", whether historical or contemporary, may find a
 new place to call "home." </p>
<p>Odili Donald Odita was born in Enugu, Nigeria; raised in Columbus, 
Ohio and received an MFA from Vermont's Bennington College in 1990. 
Since then, Odita has been included in exhibitions in Africa, North 
America and Europe, such as DAK'ART 2004, the Dakar Biennial of 
Contemporary Art and the 52nd International Art Exhibition at the 2007 
Venice Biennale. Odita is currently Associate Professor of Painting at 
Tyler School of Art, Temple University in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>The Project Space is a dynamic new location dedicated to a new series
 of site-specific works and projects at the Studio Museum. This recent 
addition to the exhibition program continues the Museum's commitment to 
activating multiple architectural sites throughout the building such as 
the lobby, atrium and facade that provide artists with laboratories for 
innovative, contemporary art projects.</p>
<p>The installation, "Equalizer" is currently on view at the Studio Museum in Harlem until April 2008.</p>
