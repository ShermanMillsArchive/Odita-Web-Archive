          Since the early 90s Odili Donald Odita's work has consistently employed 
          found, mundane materials and images culled from diverse sources including 
          art, cinema, advertising, fashion as well as print and, electronic media. 
          His works rely on processes involving repetition, reuse, recontextualization 
          and remix. Consequently his work has tackled western stereotypes, myths 
          and other forms of social transaction -as found, common ideas, images, 
          and forms of social exchange that specifically shape notions of race 
          and gender in America.<br>
          <br>
          The Invisible Empire which was presented at Gallery 101 in Ottawa in 
          1999 enacted a powerful and elegant synthesis of these elements. Significantly, 
          the works hover between single unrelated pieces and installations, refusing 
          both yet operating between them through temporary and meaningful collusions. 
          </font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"><font size="2"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><img src="untitled_paradise.jpg" width="294" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></font></font></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">While 
          they function as discrete proposals, combined, the works open up a performative 
          space of inquiry into the mythic constructs of modernist painting and 
          the black body. Most of the works engage painting as idea, discipline, 
          language or history. "Untitled (Paradise)," 1999, features 
          a small vertical rectangular dark mixed-media painting set against a 
          light floral wallpaper square. It exists through a tension provoked 
          by the juxtaposition of a 'high culture' framed work, the product of 
          the gestural bravado of an expressionist stroke of male artistic genius. 
          and 'low culture' feminine, flowery, decorative mass-produced wallpaper. 
          But we witness a further implosion within the framed component: it is 
          nothing more than a metaphor of painting. A metaphor which debunks painting 
          by reducing the very foundations of the Romantic notion of sublime, 
          namely nature and landscape, reduced to materials and motifs.<br>
          <br>
          On an adjoining wall, "Object. 1999," acts as a visual anchor, 
          working with the gallery's architecture to define the axis of experience. 
          The work consists of six framed black monochromes lit by bare, clear 
          light bulbs suspended from black wire and presented on a rectangular 
          background made of the repetition of a black and white film still. In 
          this jungle image, a startled white woman beams her flashlight up to 
          the buff bare chest of a black male. She appears fully, and properly 
          dressed, diminutive and marginal. Yes, she is the one who, eyes wide 
          open, lights up the scene. In marked contrast, the unclothed black male 
          occupies half the image. But his physical presence is just that. Matter 
          moving to the rhythm of some obscure determination. Eves closed, zombie-like, 
          intentionality, and signifiers of identity are denied him: he is an 
          object. It is against this background that the six monochromes must 
          be read. Significantly, they replicate what is going in the image: a 
          black flash-like surface is highlighted by a directed bare light source. 
          Object thus visually articulates the relationship between the myths 
          of Western painting and of the black body.<br>
          <br>
          Directly across the room, "Cutout," 1999, consists in a small 
          black circular monochrome painted onto the gallery wall. Svnecdochically 
          related to the black body of Object, it is the object defined by its 
          trajectory of the pocket light's beam arrested on and by that black 
          body. While the mage repeated in Object clearly foregrounds the stereotypical 
          association of whiteness with light and vision, and of blackness with 
          darkness and blindness, those tired, yet still potent clich√©s, 
          are poetically undone by the power of the small black circle. Isolated 
          against the wall's vast expanse of whiteness. Cutout shows Western othering 
          constructions of blackness for what they are: abstracting, reductionist, 
          instrumentalist, commodifving projection sort of desire. It also reverses 
          these reading by positioning the black circle as a porthole, and thus 
          a privileged position of vision. Most importantly, it allows for a fully 
          embodied black subject to willfully emerge and move freely across the 
          white cube of the gallery.<br>

          this mixed media work, the image of a young African woman, culled from 
          a second-hand hardcover anthropology book and colour-photocopied in 
          brown on sheets of white paper, is pasted totem-like from floor to ceiling 
          onto a greenish-light-brown vertical strip painted onto the gallery 
          wall. B</font><font size="2"></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">oth 
          in title and in spirit, it acknowledges Adrian Pipers 1970s "Mythic 
          Being" which is often only known through texts and reproductions. 
          Discourse, reproduction and birth are thus literally and symbolically 
          linked. This rhythmically repeated rectangle flattens and misquotes 
          Judd's minimalist sculptures, reducing them to the frames of a film 
          strip. Furthermore, the stylized repeated brown image confronts the 
          legacy of Warhol and his socialites. On the floor, a small mound of 
          mulch, a synthetic brown earth synonymous with North American suburb, 
          acts as the "natural" birthplace of the announced mythic being. 
          The piece thus debunks the foundation of the black body's mythic status, 
          a mythification achieved through the manufacturing and dissemination 
          of specific and unfounded kinds of images, discourses and sciences - 
          issues which Keith Piper has pointedly addressed in Fictions of Science 
          (1996).<br>
          <br>
          Directly across the room, "Couture (Me, Jane)," 1999, a digitally-manipulated 
          image shows Kate Moss acting out the role of Jane, the jungle-wear, 
          barely-clad, wide-eyed white woman with suitably wild hair and sparsely 
          there makeup. In the context of the exhibition, this small work reinforces 
          the otherness of women, strengthens the association of women and nature/primitive 
          (a category shared with the black body; remember Freud's definition 
          of female sexuality as black continent), while it also distances that 
          otherness by showing it as a put-on. Couture (Me, Jane) thus provides 
          a 90's equivalent of the scene enacted in Object. The wilderness set 
          and the black body arc evacuated: luxury commodities of the exotic kind 
          have taken their place around the white female body.<br>
          <br>
          "Erotic Invisible Empires," 1999, is a very powerful piece 
          that enlists an "emergency red" background with poetic precision.

          it, a framed fragment of a Hollywood B-movie poster, salvaged in a flea 
          market, appears before the repeated image of an abandoned, starving 
          and crying African child, an image made all too familiar in the 60s 
          and 70s in Biafra, crisscrossed with the reality of AIDS. civil and 
          ethnic war, drought and famine, and re-articulated since in a seemingly 
          endless list of crisis zones. </font><font size="2"></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Across 
          the room, a large hard-edge work made of acrylic-latex wall paint applied 
          on the gallery wall clearly positions Odita's work in the broader context 
          shaped by the practice of contemporary conceptual artists who use Modernist 
          painting as a reservoir of available forms and motifs to be reinvested, 
          as a repository of looks to be pillaged, misquoted, misused and subverted. 
          A seeming example of hard-edge abstraction, "Intermission," 
          1999, is further displaced by its title which humorously positions it 
          as an in-between, a retreat.<br>
          <br>
          The Invisible Empire operates in mixed border zones of discourses and 
          practices by complicating binary structures of otherness. The exhibition's 
          greatest contribution is its original and productive conflation of myths. 
          By enunciating the successive leaps of faith by which painting was made 
          to meet the sublime, which in turn was linked to the unconscious which, 
          in turn, the primitivist fantasy conflated with the other, the artist 
          succeeds in freeing both, and in suggesting viable positions and strategies 
          for Others to reclaim painting and redefine society.<br>
