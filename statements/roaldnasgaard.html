      <td colspan="2" height="2694" valign="top"><p class="style7">Odita painted abstractly
            until 1993 when he stopped. For several years thereafter his larger
            project, poised at the intersection of his African and Euro-American
            origins and influences, found its most discursive articulation in
            photography and installation projects. When he returned to abstract
            painting in 1999 it was to re-invent it, as he has explained, as
            a critique of the universalizing grid of modernist space as well
            as its vertical, stationary egocentricity as expressed in Barnet
            Newman&rsquo;s declaration of the &lsquo;I&rsquo;.
          Odita&rsquo;s alternative solution was to desublimate the space of
          his hardedge abstraction, profane it a little, so to speak, spreading
          it out horizontally, opening it to narrative exposition played out
          by engaging the viewer in simultaneous complex and alternative readings
        of his pictorial structures. </p>
        <p class="style7"><span class="style7">In the larger perspective it is fair to remain a little surprised
          that a younger artist like Odita should find abstract painting useful
          again. It <em>was</em> only yesterday, after all, that we doubted that abstract
          painting, let alone painting in ge</span>neral, had a life, much less a future.
          For the last quarter of the twentieth-century visuality itself had
          seemed under siege, more so in the United States perhaps than in Canada
          or Europe. As the art world in the 1970s reoriented itself to doing
          conceptually-based socio-political work, the visual elements of visual
          art were largely consigned to play documentary rather than creative
          roles. The pleasure of sight was either transformed into the male gaze,
          or, because of its alleged passiveness, came to seem merely self-indulgent
          in a world demanding intellectual critique and social action.</p>
        <p class="style7">In the United States, perhaps the single most
            salutary event giving renewed licence to the practice of abstract
            painting, was the rediscovery, at age 69, of Bridget Riley in New
            York as a consequence of her much acclaimed exhibitions at the DIA
            Center for the Arts and PaceWildenstein in New York. Riley, as we
            will recall, was a veteran of the MOMA&rsquo;s
            <em>Responsive Eye</em>, 1965, a fun-fair of an Op Art show that,
            however, sank critically, the active &lsquo;opticality&rsquo; of
            much of the work condemned as gimmickry when juxtaposed to the repose
            of the Greenbergian Modernist paintings of Kenneth Noland and Morris
            Louis in the same show. Riley&rsquo;s work could gain no foothold
            in a critical climate that reduced her work to simple mechanistic
            concerns with optics. Those who knew her art more deeply, of course,
            also saw it more complexly. When John Russell first encountered Riley&rsquo;s
            work in London in 1963, he described its dramatic and unexpected
            swoops and thrust, its threats of breakdowns and dissolution, as &quot;almost
            frantically subjective and an unremitting search for truth in private
            feeling.&quot;<span class="style8">1</span> Another
          London critic, Nigel Gosling, describing the tensions that grew out
          of the speed, scale and color temperature of her visual fields, spoke
          of how they could make us &ldquo;feel with our eyes.&rdquo;<span class="style8">2</span></p>
        <p class="style7">It is useful to recall this history because,
            as it has turned out, much of the new abstract painting, like Odita&rsquo;s, that began to
          emerge internationally in the later 1990s, takes few of its cues from
          the Modernist abstract painting tradition that, following Clement Greenberg,
          culminated in Postpainterly Abstraction. Instead its real lineage is
          rooted in what has been called the &lsquo;apostate&rsquo; Modernisms,
          those alternative non-figurative investigations of the 1960s - from
          so-called Op Art to Minimalism - which formalist criticism so severely
          condemned, especially because of their emphasis on experience as it
          stretched through time, or, as Michael Fried said, it was subject to
          indefinite &ldquo;duration.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
            In 2001 I had occasion to juxtapose new paintings by Odita and Riley
            (<em>R&ecirc;ve</em>, 1999, from the PaceWildenstein show), and a
            comparably new work by the Montreal artists Guido Molinari who had
            also participated in <em>The Responsive Eye</em>.<span class="style8">3</span> Molinari remains
            a much under-rated artist in the larger world. Since the mid-1950s
            he had been developing hard-edge painting differently from New York;
            with reference to Mondrian, Pollock and Newman, but devoid, like
            Riley, of even a hint of that Matissian lyricism and illusion that
            still clung during the 1960s to other stripe painters like Noland
            and Gene Davis. Instead of striving for the time-suspending &ldquo;presentness&rsquo; of
            Postpainterly Abstraction, instead of wanting to be seen instantaneously
            or holistically, Molinari constructed his 1960s Stripe Paintings
            so that they functioned as events caused by the visual interaction
            of the juxtaposed colors in the eye of the beholder. We might say
            that Molinari&rsquo;s concern
            was not the aesthetics of color, but its dynamics, color released
            to give full expression to its chromatic energies and interactions,
            never ceasing to perform in response to the viewer caught up in the
            space that radiated outwards from the paintings. To account for comparable
            experiences evoked by his Minimalist objects and extended structures
            (if more visceral than visual) Robert Morris coined the term &ldquo;existence
            art.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="style7">It is out of the tradition of these pulsating
            painted worlds of Molinari and Riley that Odita&rsquo;s work emerges. He shares their perception
          of pictorial space as an energetic field of infinite possibilities,
          suspicious of fixed identities, embracing the unpredictable, the irrational
          and the transitory. Significantly, however, alongside the measured
          choreographies of Riley (who at the beginning of the twenty-first century
          was rehearsing the decorative graces of the late Matisse) or of Molinari
          (once again touching base with Mondrian&rsquo;s Boogi-Woogies) Odita&rsquo;s
          rhythms stand out as jagged and erratic. He can be graceful and lyrical,
          but more usually Odita&rsquo;s paintings dance to less ethereal tunes
          than those of his predecessors from the 1960s. They drive our eyes
          with sharp and interpenetrating shafts or planes of dissonant color
          planes. Their forms diverge and converge and contort themselves around
          multiple horizon lines, and meet in curt juxtapositions and abrupt
          stand-offs, as if caught up in an excitement that covets restlessness
          over resolution. Odita&rsquo;s palette is similarly idiosyncratic and
          personally inflected. Unlike his predecessors it belongs less to the
          studio and to art than to a life world, whether its sources lie in,
          as is often repeated, West African textile patterns, or in retro American
          decorators&rsquo; colours that fascinate him, or in the ubiquitous
          flashiness of the commercial world, the TV screen, the computer, visual
          stimulation jumbled in sensory overload, excess and fragmentation.
          Odita quite happily compromises his abstraction in other ways, flirting
          with landscape and other illusionistic spaces, transgressions to Modernist
          flatness long sanctioned by Gerhard Richter.</p>
        <p class="style7">Odita has described the viewer&ndash;painting relationship
          in this way: &ldquo;One does not penetrate an image, it penetrates
          you &ndash; like
          a slogan, or propaganda,&rdquo;<span class="style8">4</span> inflecting our concrete perceptual
          experience of his abstracted constructions with something like directed
          content. There have been a number of critical attempts to account for
          how the new abstract painting that appeared towards the end of the
          1990s has resuscitated a discredited Modernist tradition of abstraction
          by delivering it back into the world of social and urban space reconfigured
          by the new technologies of representation and communication. These
          accounts are usually rooted in a critical anxiety to differentiate
          clearly between the old abstraction, perceived to be single-mindedly
          tied to transcendent purity and autonomy, and the new polysemic one.
          They are obsessed with vanquishing a myth of monolithic Modernism which
          has perhaps lives more vividly in the mind of the postmodernist critic
          than it ever did in the social reality of the production of modernist
          abstraction (except perhaps in the long lingering final days of Postpainterly
          Abstraction). It seems an odd defense of the work of the artists like
          Odita, who largely honour the Modernist tradition and embrace it full
          of belief in its continuing vigor. </p>
        <p class="style7">These new abstract painters that emerged in the
            late 1990s are optimistically forward-looking rather than nervously
            retrospective, which is perhaps why, consciously or unwittingly,
            they have found themselves continuing the historical lineage of &ldquo;apostate&rdquo; Modernism. As a tradition
          they have found it - unlike the Neo-Geo painters of the 1980s for whom
          Op was a sign of modernist failure good only for ironic appropriation
          - a vital living model for the future of abstraction painting. Neither
          Op Art nor Minimalist &ldquo;existence&rdquo; art was after all a style,
          a reductive style such as Postpainterly Abstraction became, nor commensurate
          with the ideologically idealist program to which criticism reduced
          the project of twentieth-century abstract painting. On the contrary,
          the &ldquo;apostate&rdquo; Modernisms did not seek eternal essences
          or transcendence, but perceived of reality as a series of constantly
          renewed relations with one&rsquo;s surroundings, on the part of both
          artist and viewer, that were in constant living transformation. Theirs
          was, and is, a mode of operation, a performative activity, that at
          the least echoes John Cage&rsquo;s notion of art as acting in &ldquo;imitation
          of nature in her manner of operation.&quot; As such, purity (and the
          alleged purity of Modernist abstraction is greatly exaggerated) or
          corruption are largely beside the point, whereas the specifics, in
          the case of a Donald Odita, of what it means to be an African-born
          and Ohio-raised artist living in an unstable everyday world is the
          subject matter that drives his painting.</p>
        <p class="style7">On an earlier occasion I asked the question of
            whether, or how, those problems of identity, race and culture as
            they arise from Odita&rsquo;s
          larger artistic project can express themselves in abstract painting?
          The question is probably quite wrong-headed because it burdens visual
          art with logocentric expectations; and why, as Mieke Ball has asked, &ldquo;should
          the visual field [have to] obey rules imposed by language?&rdquo;<span class="style8">5</span>          May
          we not trust the state of sensitive &ldquo;being&rdquo; into which
          paintings like Odita&rsquo;s thrusts us, to embody their own order
          of intelligence before we translate it into metaphors, signs or symbols?
          Or alternatively, as Barbara Maria Stafford maintains: &ldquo;The beholder&rsquo;s
          heightened perceptual acuity reminds us of the sensuality of the intellect
          and of the responsive flesh lodged within visual experience.&rdquo;<span class="style8">6</span></p>
        <p class="style7">It would seem that by necessity Odita has found
            his way towards the optical tradition&rsquo;s space and strategies
            of destabilized perception as the most viable instrument for the
            expression of dislocation and decenteredness. It is surprisingly
            true of much of the new abstraction that its presentations of heterotopian
            spaces are rarely sites for mourning or regret. We should not be
            surprised then that Odita describes his own abstract paintings not
            only as stripped of &ldquo;the politicized
          pointing&rdquo; of his earlier work, but also as more positive, offering
          up a painted space &ldquo;where we can be free.&rdquo;<span class="style8">7</span></p>
