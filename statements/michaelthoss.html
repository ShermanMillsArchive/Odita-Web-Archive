      <td colspan="2" width="600" height="428" valign="top"><p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">A constant in Odili Donald Odita�s oeuvre is his engagement with 
          the duality of cultural codes, which make up our social representations. 
          The romanticized discourse about the supposedly other, for example, 
          exoticizes anything strange in order to ostracize it socially. <br>
          <br>
          The artist poses the question what it means �to be black� 
          with the two wall paintings �Body/Space� and �Two 
          Black Alike and Apart Become Different� in the back room of the 
          gallery. He shows with these two works that there are no perceptions 
          of blackness that are identical, similarly to two entirely identical 
          black quadrants, but that the circumstance of being called �black� 
          signifies a cultural phenomena rather than a matter of pigments. �The 
          black canvas is simple, but the discourse of black is extremely complex,� 
          says the artist in an interview reprinted in his last catalog. <br>
          <br>
          The artist, who lives now in north Florida, already questioned with 
          his work entitled �Birth of a Mythic Being� in 1999 the 
          one-sided representation of the African as an anthropological research 
          object. He referred to a work by Adrian Piper called �Mythic Being� 
          from the year 1970: Odita selected a representation of a young African 
          woman from a standard edition for Ethnology and reproduced copies of 
          her in an Andy Warhol-like fashion before he assembled her in totem 
          pole style on the gallery wall. In front of the collage he placed a 
          dirt pile that seemed to make reference to the birth site of the �mythological 
          black creature� in pre-historic Africa. However, in reality the 
          fictional mound consisted of potting soil and ironically remarked upon 
          the artificiality and mythological uplifting of nature in Western civilization 
          discourse, which until today celebrates the African as the epitome of 
          naturalness. <br>
          <br>
          This two-edged bipolarity of cultural codes is also visible in Odita�s 
          abstract paintings, which can be read like sheets of electronic music 
          (with a lot of drums and bass as it seems to me): Color turns into pure 
          rhythm and structures the picture from within.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="there.jpg" width="383" height="320" align="right"> 
          The artist combines in the seemingly cool arrangements of parallel and 
          pointedly approaching color ribbons and fractured geometric shapes synthetic 
          and organic colors that hint at different cultural contexts: signal 
          colors of the pop as well as the ibo culture of present-day Nigeria 
          from where Odita�s family originates. He points out the double 
          inheritance of western and African abstraction for which he opens new 
          space in his works. The three works, �There,� �Heat,� 
          and �Possible World,� which were completed in the last months 
          and are exhibited here for the first time together, draw their tension 
          especially from the interplay of different traditions of the African, 
          European, and North American Modernism. <br>
          <br>
          Odita synthesizes developments within Afro-American modernism, which 
          counts as its predecessors artists like the Nigerian Uzo Egonu and the 
          South-African Ernest Mancoba. Egonu and Mancoba, whose abstract paintings 
          can be found in the ritual clothing codes and murals of their countries 
          of origin, gave much impulse to the European avant garde since the 1940s; 
          one in the circle of the Goldsmith College in London and the other within 
          the artist group COBRA. <br>
          <br>
          These painters juxtapose their artistic abstractions�which they 
          derive from one social space�with the totalizing project of western 
          Modernism, which reflects the objective laws of the universe as mysticism 
          of the elementary within the abstraction of the art work.<br>
          <br>
          Odita�s canon of forms reminds one of the paintings of the Igbo 
          women in Nigeria, which are called Uli-painting and which symbolize 
          a body as well as a wall painting technique. But this Africa is transmitted 
          foremost aesthetically. Africa is for Odita, who grew up in the United 
          States, consequently only one of several references which were shaped 
          by his experience as Afro-American in a predominately white society: 
          �My Igbo-ness is one of the many things that help shape what I 
          am. Though I didn�t grown up in Nigeria . . . there is the rupture 
          between experience and perception about being black in America, and 
          being a first generation African family in the US.�<br>
          <br>
          Odita�s paintings seem to us to be filled with a nearly vibrating 
          plasticity if we don�t try to approach them from the point of 
          a central perspective (Renaissance). In this sense one can call Odita�s 
          artistic point of view truly eccentric.<br>
          <br>
          His works remind of an assignment that Paul Klee once gave his students 
          when he made them paint tracks from different perspectives. The perspective 
          of the observer changes so radically with his angle of vision due to 
          the release of the central perspective that infinitive variations of 
          lateral optics appear. <br>
          <br>
          Odita�s abstractions likewise enable the observer a reading of 
          multiple and changing perspectives, which allow the center to move and 
          to open a mobile three-dimensional room for the viewer: stripes seemingly 
          ending in the void can all of a sudden be spatially recognized.<br>
          <br>
          This way of composition parallels the polyphony in music: In the polyphony 
          a multitude of independent voices merge �similar to strong parallel 
          color lines in the painting�into a constantly repeating circular 
          movement. The absence of a hierarchical center�a leading instrument 
          or a soloist�reflects, for example, in the polyphone antiphonal 
          singing of the Aka-pygmies the social space of its members.<br>
          <br>
          Likewise, Odita�s monochrome paintings structure the surrounding 
          room in an almost architectural fashion: The five works called installation 
          without title, which are exhibited in the south terrain of the gallery 
          and which were also shown a few weeks ago in Vienna and Frankfurt, are 
          simultaneously paintings and sculptures. They remind of windows, gates 
          and buildings and internalize the invisible cities through which we 
          imagine them.<br>
          <br>
          His imaginary landscapes and cities define Odili Donald Odita as a third 
          space in which the all too tight concept of western Modernism is extended 
          towards other cultural codes: �There are other worlds outside 
          of this world, and that notion calls into question what Modernism is�and 
          how Modernism was mined outside of itself and brought into the center 
          space. But this process of presentation in the center ignores�or 
          doesn�t regard the extremities anymore.�</font></p>
