      <td height="1439" colspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Odili Donald Odita grew up, as he  says, &quot;with two senses of being.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out in the world, he was a  Midwestern American kid, reading comic books, playing video games, absorbing  the cultural messages around him. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At home, he was Nigerian. Although  he was 6 months old when his family fled the Biafran war, his parents kept  alive his connection to his country and Igbo people through stories, customs  and African art, which is his art-historian father's m&eacute;tier. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like many immigrant children, Odita,  39, found this tug of war uncomfortable. Western perceptions of Africa  as violent and backward exacerbated the problem. Consequently, he says, &quot;I  couldn't express my culture.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After earning his MFA at Bennington   College  in Vermont  in 1990, he moved to New York,  chucked his grad school training and was trying to find himself artistically  when he met Okwui Enwezor, an encounter that changed both his psyche and his  art. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enwezor is an influential and  respected Nigerian curator and writer. One of the art-world cadre of global  citizens, he has curated prestigious shows in Europe  and Africa and will soon become academic dean  at the San Francisco Art Institute. When Odita met him in 1994, Enwezor, who  had come to the United States  to study political science, was unknown. But he had embarked on an ambitious  project. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He and Nigerian artist Olu Oguibe  aimed to bring the contemporary artists of Africa  and the African Diaspora to the world stage. Their vehicle: NKA, a journal of  African art. Odita joined African artists and thinkers, who gathered every  night in Enwezor's apartment, and started working and writing for the magazine  by its second issue. The intellectual ferment was exhilarating. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We were trying to define  contemporary African art,&quot; he says, brightening at the memory. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not surprisingly, the issue is still  under debate, but Odita credits the early discussion with opening the door. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It challenged some of the  negative ideas people have about Africa  and opened the space for a more serious and even-leveled consideration of  African art and African artists within the larger debate of contemporary  art,&quot; he says. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite initial resistance --- he  recalls dealers dismissing artists whose names they couldn't pronounce --- they  had remarkable success in promoting artists. Odita also made a name for himself  with media-based and installation art about &quot;the black body in a  social/cultural space.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through his connection with this  group, Odita found his identity, as a contemporary African artist. He found his  artistic vehicle during a 1998 residency in upstate New    York, when he decided to return to  painting. The inaugural show at Wertz Contemporary (formerly Kubatana) in Atlanta's  Castleberry Hill district south of downtown features the latest incarnation of  his hard-edge paintings. They are dynamic compositions of shards, wedges and  planes of flat, idiosyncratic color in unexpected combinations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His earliest paintings of this type,  made between 1991 and 1993, grew out of his observations about modern life:  television and its manipulation of culture; computers and their creation of  hyperspace through digital codes; and wallpaper and its ironic similarity to  high modern abstract painting. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In these paintings, Nigeria  is the subject and driving force. Odita has infused abstract forms with memory  and emotional meaning. He calls the paintings &quot;internal geographies.&quot;  They suggest water, the meeting of land and sky, the blazing sun. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Nigerian landscape is a  dream to me,&quot; says the Florida   State University  art professor. &quot;It feeds me spiritually. . . . With all my education, I  have no words to express the magic. I try to reach that in my art.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His show is titled &quot;Paradise,&quot;  but he is no starry-eyed romantic. If the paintings are his dreams of an  African Eden, the diaristic drawings in his show communicate the darker side of  the story. Described with a spidery line and blots of black ink, &quot;Oil  Spill&quot; alludes to the waste of resources through greed and corruption. An  emaciated child, straightforwardly drawn, brings the viewer face-to-face with  the suffering brought on by drought, war and nonintervention. Often loose and  expressionistic, the drawings seem to be the place where Odita lets his  emotions go. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The artist, who is married to  Swiss-born arts administrator Emanuelle A. Kihm and has a 1-year-old child,  trots the globe for exhibits in Europe  and Africa. He seems to regard the United    States more as a base of operations, a  provincial outpost, than home. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm most comfortable around  Nigerians and people with a layered sense of the world,&quot; he says. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paintings also allude to the  hyperspace created by modern technology, in which everyone is a click or a  cellphone call away, and to the revved-up pace it engenders. &quot;I'm aware of  the systemic network we exist in, that crosses cultures, nations, genders, even  aesthetics,&quot; he says. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the dislocation he felt in  his youth made for anxiety, he now considers it a blessing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The ground is shifting now,  but I am already used to it, and I have a better understanding of other  possibilities,&quot; he says. &quot;It prepared me for the contemporary  condition.&quot; </font></p>        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
