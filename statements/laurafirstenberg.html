          The "had dream of modernism" is what T.J. Clark in Pollock's 
          Abstraction, writes of art's inability to escape the metaphoric, the 
          commodity. This fate for painting is discussed in light of Cecil Beaton's 
          1951 Vogue photographs which employed Pollock's Autumn Rhythm as decorative 
          backdrop for fashion spread, pointing to the modernist problematic of 
          kitsch and the avant-garde. This translation, deflation, and entrance 
          of art into the popular domain, and vice-versa, in turn is played upon 
          by Warhol, Johns, Rauschenberg, et al. And it is to the legacy and irony 
          of abstract painting's resistance to collapsing into decoration, as 
          evidenced in early Greenbergian difficulty with Pollock's all-over gestural 
          style (webs likened to textile for example), to this tension of the 
          reception of abstraction as decoration, that is of particular interest 
          to the painterly production of Nigerian-American artist Odili Donald 
          Odita. <br>
          <br>
          Odita goes so far as to literalize this rhetoric by producing wallpaper/collage 
          paintings, calling into questions notions of taste and decor, and using 
          mass media inspired grids as his point of departure to extend the Warholian 
          critique of authenticity and capital to contemporary discourse of identity 
          in the visual field. O<img src="colortheory.jpg" width="406" height="278" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="right">dita 
          discusses the use of wallpaper in his enterprise in terms of its signaling 
          the historical negotiation and entrance into the realm of modernist 
          of painting of the quotidian, the "low," located in his practice 
          from the decorative to detritus, from his early base materialist practice 
          to his present sleek hard edge style. As such, he retroactively takes 
          on the major tropes of abstraction. For example, in painting directly 
          on the wall of the gallery in "Intermission," or in extending 
          his lines to the edge of his canvases, pointing to the realm of "the 
          real" in "Contact," he deliberately engages with historical 
          debates on the desublimation of painting and on questioning the parameters 
          of the pictorial field.<br>
          <br>
          His work evokes more than a fusion of cultural practices and experiences 
          of African and Euro-American origins and influences. Odita's interest 
          in American pop culture and artistic production, coalescent with West 
          African visual tropes, critically engages with the compounded history 
          of Africa's reciprocal relationship to Occidental modernism. Odita is 
          able to enlist a post-colonial critique that doesn't need to rely on 
          the textual or on the body, but does so on the levels of appropriation, 
          taste, desire, and perception, vis-a-vis his serial and signature brand 
          of non-figurative abstraction.<br>
          <br>
          Criticism of Odita's practices stresses his work as the product of a 
          syncretic language of both African and American visual and cultural 
          influences and experiences, yet the work formally seems to concern itself 
          equally with the negotiation of the status and life of painting at the 
          turn of the century. Perhaps his task is to negotiate the questions 
          of subjectivity in non-figurative terms. Early experiments with base 
          materials resulting in Dubuffet-inspired-heavily factured surfaces were 
          abandoned for a present ambitious and mature style based on post-Pollockian 
          and Stellian opticality, which marks an inheritance of the legacy of 
          color field painters in the destabilization of perception. Odita's optical 
          play is performed by his signature severed, jagged planes of a dissonant 
          palette. This unpenetrable animated surface, difficult to access as 
          a totality, brings the observer back onto his/her own body.<br>
          <br>
          His current exhibition entitled "Color Theory" at Florence 
          Lynch gallery in New York City directly references both the artist's 
          relationship to Color Field painting and Op Art of the sixties and the 
          politics of identity rehearsed in his own work. Stella's grids and Newman's 
          zips serve as a point of departure for Odita's sonorous reanimation 
          of reductive formalist painting. The zip of Newman is reworked and tilted 
          from the sublimated vertical axis to a multi-tiered diagonal line moving 
          towards the horizontal, creating a vibrating, oscillating, and pulsing 
          surface, prohibiting the eye from fixing on an image. This pitch into 
          the orientation of line produces a dynamic and jagged pattern as leitmotif, 
          and collapses the dichotomous rhetoric of the high and the low (culture/nature), 
          so resonant in the history of modem painting. His tiers of color are 
          dehierarchized alluding to both formal and cultural imperatives.<br>
          <br>
          The artist and his critics often reference the paintings' formal evocation 
          of West African textiles in terms of pattern. This can be extended to 
          the ways in which questions of identity surface in the work. In so doing, 
          Odita elicits notions of West African textiles as mnemonic and communicative 
          devices, and more generally, as popular emblems of Afrocentricity when 
          appropriated in the West, mass produced and made into universalizing 
          signs referencing continental "Africa." <img src="pan-am.jpg" width="363" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="left">This 
          mode of identification is turned against itself in Odita's paintings. 
          He extends this critique to the legacy of Africa's role in and relationship 
          to Euro-American modernist abstraction, one that is completely interrelated 
          yet historically sequestered in terms of circulation, reception, and 
          categorization. In putting pressure on the classification of "Contemporary 
          African Art," Odita revises the language of American hard edge 
          abstraction and inserts his own narratives. He maintains, "In my 
          paintings, I am dealing with memory, the presence and absence of experiences 
          removed; nostalgia for a lost past, and the hope for something new and 
          better."<br>
