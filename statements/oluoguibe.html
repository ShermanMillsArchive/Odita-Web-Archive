        <p class="style3">ON ODILI DONALD ODITA</p>
        <p class="style1">Forthright is a rare word in the contemporary art world. It is a word
          that I like to associate with Odili Donald Odita. Honest, forthright,
          with a sense of integrity and dignity that comes through in the sophisticated
          and subtle, yet deeply engaged nature of his work. </p>
        <p class="style1">The wonderful thing about our profession as artists is that it retains
          its openness to diverse gifts and inclinations. There is room enough
          for the deep and the banal, the serious and the gimmicky, the invested
          and the pedestrian, the philosophical and the frivolous. Over a decade
          and half of practice Odita has remained on the deep and philosophical
          lane, seeking beneath the surface of things, questioning the efficacy
          of strategies and methods, investigating the limits of language and
          rhetoric, insisting on the genealogy and prospect of forms, concepts
          and words. As an artist he pays close attention to the historical burden
          as well as potential of every element in the work, be it medium, design
          strategy or motif, or technique. A painting is not simply a painting;
          it is also part of a long tradition, a history; an aesthetic as well
          as political narrative from which it may not easily be isolated or
          divorced. A color is not to be considered without full awareness of
          its multiple valences both chromatic and metaphorical since color and
          pigment are conceptual anchors and potent signifiers. A traditional
          support such as canvas does not escape associations that locate it
          first within the Western tradition, but also tie it to subsequent moments
          in the history of its use, including its adoption in colonized cultures
          and its resilient and seldom interrogated genderedness. In other words
          there is a post-structuralist sensibility evident in Odita's work that
          disassembles form and sensitizes the viewer to its syntax, but more
          importantly, transcends the concern with syntax as mere formal assemblage
          of fragments to highlight the cultural imbrications in those fragments. </p>
        <p class="style1">Though Odita has produced installations and photo-based pieces over
          the past decade, he nevertheless works primarily as a painter. His
          paintings range from hard-edge to tonal abstraction with occasional
          invocation of abstract landscape painting. I have related his paintings
          to modal jazz for their ability to combine a spare integrity with tonal
          effusion. In same manner that modal jazz aspires toward pure sound,
          Odita's paintings achieve a significant level of visual and chromatic
          purity that lends them vibrancy and spaciousness. His use of space
          is lean, deep and resonant. Even so, in same way that modal jazz refined
          social protest into spare but inimitably infectious sound, with Coltrane's
          notes imbued with the eloquent sound of activism, Odita's elements
          are in fact loaded with social questions and implications as well as
          challenges for abstraction as a language: How does abstraction deal
          with the reality of race in the post-millennial age, for instance?
          How does pigment speak to our obvious diversity and the beauty of that
          diversity, as well as the insidious machinations of exoticism and stereotypy?
          How do social striations translate on canvas? How does theory transcend
          its rhetorical shortcomings and open itself to its full aesthetic and
          civic potency? How does beauty serve as vehicle in the ultimate fulfillment
          of the creative process which is submission to the work of art? </p>
        <p class="style1">Odita rejects as vacuous, indeed non-existent, the kind of formalist
          or so-called "pure" abstraction promoted at mid-century especially
          in America, and insists instead that "all visual materials are culturally
          grounded, and it is important to recognize where their meaning is derived
          from." As such he reminds us that the challenge of utopia cannot be
          escaped through false evacuation of meaning from beauty or form. </p>
