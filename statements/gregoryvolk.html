          Donald Odita at Florence Lynch and Riva</strong><br>
          <br>
          Odili Donald Odita has earned a reputation for his colorful acrylic 
          abstract paintings, in which slightly irregular bands, elongated triangles, 
          stretched-out trapezoids and other off-kilter geometric forms extend 
          horizontally across the support. While Odita's works have roots in patterned 
          geometric abstraction, their choppy contours suggest both turbulence 
          and organic growth. They also pull in hints of big landscapes, big skies, 
          textile decorations and "traditional" clothing from Odita's 
          native Nigeria. (He now lives in the U.S.) Odita's is a complex, poignant 
          approach to this kind of abstraction, and he successfully melds Western 
          and African influences.<br>
          <br>
          These simultaneous exhibitions arose from a recent trip Odita took to 
          Nigeria and provided a welcome opportunity to see not only a new selection 
          of paintings but also other works- notably, drawings and sculptures-that 
          flesh out this artist's enterprise. <img src="overhereoverthere.jpg" width="375" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">At 
          Florence Lynch, small, seemingly rapid drawings on paper of figures 
          and objects, in tempera, charcoal, pencil and pastel, comprised a visual 
          diary of an expatriate's return. In Queen Mother (2001), a forceful, 
          solitary woman is framed by an orange half oval in the background. Scattered 
          glitter at the sides adds a touch of exuberance and bedazzlement. In 
          Gentlemen (2001), a splotch of turquoise on a pensive male figure's 
          shirt and the red and orange of a diagonally striped headband are precisely 
          the kinds of colors that Odita uses to such advantage in his paintings. 
          Several works, particularly Burning (2001), in which a reddish mass, 
          suggesting fire and malevolence, is suspended in front of a male figure's 
          chin, evoke the internecine violence and severe government repression 
          that have plagued Nigeria for years. Other works are far more whimsical 
          and lyrical. For an exacting painter like Odita, showing such drawings 
          was a risk, but it worked. Coupled with a small selection of his paintings, 
          they gave you a real sense of just how much Odita's experience of Nigeria 
          affects his esthetic.<br>
          <br>
          Odita's exhibition at Riva included three sculptures of modest interest. 
          <img src="halfway.jpg" width="212" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">One 
          was a wooden structure, akin to a small house on which construction 
          has stopped (Halfway, 2001). Pink on the outside and blue on the inside, 
          it refers to similar, half-finished structures Odita saw in Nigeria 
          but equally conjures a bare-bones bus shelter or a broken prison cell. 
          The real stars here, however, were wonderful, large-scale paintings 
          that have an unusual mix of ultracool geometric patterning, landscape-based 
          serenity and visual agitation. With Horizon (2001), various horizontal 
          beiges, pinks, russets, and a single line of blue suggest sweeping arid 
          expanses and a lake or a seashore. With startling oranges and deep blues, 
          Over Here, Over There (2001) is a perfect fusion of garish neon advertisements 
          and African textiles.<br>
