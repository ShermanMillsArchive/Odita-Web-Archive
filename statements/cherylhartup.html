          Odili Donald Odita's site-specific installations explore contemporary 
          notions of space and the confluence of personal memory and cultural 
          history. In his abstract paintings on canvas, wall paintings, drawings, 
          and conceptual objects, he brings aspects of African, European, and 
          American cultures into play.<br>
          <br>
          Odita is best known for his hard-edged abstract paintings, with their 
          bright vectors of color that streak the canvas like endlessly transforming 
          waves in a digital vastness. An onlooker might think of television test-band 
          patterns, African textiles, electronic music, and late-modernist painting, 
          all in brief space of viewing one work.<br>
          <br>
          These paintings have something of the look of colorfield painting of 
          the 1960s and 70s, but Odita's style is thoroughly contemporary. His 
          inspiration comes from his experiences in the New York art world of 
          the 1990s, his encyclopedic knowledge of art history, and the marvelous 
          glut of American popular culture. It is also rooted in the culture of 
          the Igbo people of Nigeria and the close, if sporadic, contact Odita's 
          family has with their ancestral land.<br>
          <br>
          Miami Art Museum's New Work: Odili Donald Odita-the artist's first one-person 
          museum exhibition in the United States-displays the two most potent 
          manifestations of Odita's work to date: acrylic-on-canvas paintings 
          which deal with general, somewhat elusive matters of identity; and conceptual 
          objects and drawings based on his travels to his homeland.<br>
          <br>
          Odita was born in Enugu, Nigeria, but spent only the first few months 
          of his life there. He came to the United States in 1966 just before 
          the Biafran War, when his father was awarded a scholarship from the 
          Nigerian government to study art and art history at Indiana State University.

          grew up in suburban Columbus, Ohio, completed his undergraduate studies 
          at Ohio State University, and received a graduate degree in fine arts 
          from Bennington College in Vermont in 1990. Bennington has been an important 
          nexus of modernist art activity since the 1950s. Some of Odita's professors, 
          for example, were friendly with the renowned critic Clement Greenberg 
          and such abstract painters as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. Odita 
          thus experienced American modernism with a remarkable intimacy, and 
          though he respected his teachers and their ideas, he and his peers, 
          like innovators of every generation, took it on themselves to challenge 
          them as well.<br>
          <br>
          After Bennington, he traveled to New York City where the art world of 
          the 1990s was dominated by multiculturalism and the politics of identity. 
          Few artists were using abstract painting as a vehicle to explore these 
          issues, although Odita continued to do so. In 1994 he met three fellow 
          Nigerians: Okwui Enwezor, who was starting a journal called Nka: Journal 
          of Contemporary African Art, and Olu Oguibe and Iké Udé, 
          who were editors there. Odita began contributing articles to the magazine 
          and through lively debates about contemporary art and cultural politics, 
          he began to shape his notions about his art and himself.<br>
          <br>
          He also began curating exhibitions of other young New York artists. 
          This, and his work with computer design-specifically with Adobe Photoshop-added 
          another dimension to the process of self-discovery. He was becoming 
          disenchanted with painting-which he increasingly saw as an exhausted 
          form-but when he discovered that he could "paint" without 
          using a brush and canvas, he realized it was possible to step outside 
          the conventions of the medium without abandoning it altogether. He returned 
          to painting with renewed confidence and a belief that it remained a 
          supple, imaginative instrument for his ideas.<br>
          <br>
          It was in this atmosphere that Odita developed his signature approach 
          to abstraction and his interest in multimedia installations. The sense 
          of space he creates in his paintings can seem, in one moment, electronic, 
          in another, scenic, and in yet another, psychological. The surfaces 
          are flat, yet they readily evoke a sense of deep space. They may teem 
          with a frenetic, pulsating energy, or possess the profound equanimity 
          of an alpine lake. Their colors combine to suggest a world that is, 
          in one light, synthetic and, in another, as natural as wooded hills. 
          They contain both the warmth of familial memory and the uncertain intimations 
          of ancestry. There is in these works, above all, a sensual richness 
          that derives from how patiently they are made and their adherence to 
          classical formal rigor.<br>
          <br>
          Odita's titles often reflect the dualities of his works, though somewhat 
          more obliquely. The names of two paintings in this exhibition, Yesterday 
          &amp; Today and Gravity's Rainbow, are taken from seminal 1960s pop 
          culture moments. The first was the name of a popular early album by 
          the Beatles, the second the title of a book by one of America's most 
          reclusive, creative, and influential contemporary novelists, Thomas 
          Pynchon. By themselves the titles are highly suggestive, and as appropriated 
          icons they are at once nostalgic and consummately ironic, in the way 
          that Postmodernist borrowings are made just for the fun of it. On the 
          other hand, Odita's sculpture Heaven Can Wait is named for a light-hearted 
          1978 American movie; in the artist's hands the words carry a wrenching 
          hubris, referring to the Nigerian elite's love of oil-and the vast wealth 
          it brings them-to the detriment of the country's common good.<br>
          <br>
          As a Nigerian living in the United States, Odita experiences certain 
          precarious balances. There are times when he is ambivalent about his 
          place as a citizen and an artist, and the perceptions-and occasional 
          misperceptions-that others have of him always arouse his curiosity. 
          This shows up as ambiguity in his work, and accounts for the masterful 
          shifting in his paintings of what constitutes "ground" and 
          "object." He sees himself as a direct descendant-and beneficiary-of 
          certain Postmodernist artists, like Philip Taaffe, Jessica Stockholder, 
          Adrian Piper, and Felix Gonzalez-Torres. In Gonzalez-Torres especially, 
          Odita admires how the artist was able to inject the austere face of 
          minimalism with the poetry of personal experience and make that experience 
          shine through his work. He sees himself continuing this personalizing 
          mission, this merging of art and contemporary life, on the way to transcending 
          the now-threadbare aesthetic certainties of last century's American 
          modernism.<br>
