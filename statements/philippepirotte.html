            about the work <em>"Body/Space" </em> (2002)? It
            seems to define an ongoing vertical strip with things becoming temporally
            concrete... </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">I first made this piece in December 2000 at the Kunsthalle in St.
          Gallen, Switzerland.  This piece is essentially taking the construct
          of the black body and placing it in space as an abstract - first beginning
          with the term "black" and taking this phrase literally and objectively
          (black as a person, a space, a thing) and placing the color directly
          on the wall.  Then I used 9 various color pigments to create
          9 rectilinear vertical forms that referenced the form of a body, and
          in turn creating a body-space (it is interesting to me that this shape
          could also connote a grave).  This body-space took on the color
          of skin types associated with 'black' people, and hence the piece creates
          another level of meaning - the interrelationship between the general
          (black wall), and the specific (colors pigments) reality of the "black" body.  In
          my work of this type I am very interested in the idea of "blackness" as
          an abstract thought, as an abstracted idea.  This inspiration
          crystallized for me after reading an interview of artist, David Hammons
          conducted by my friend, the filmmaker/scholar, Manthia Diawara for
          Art Forum Magazine in the mid/late 1990's.  In this article,
          Hammons refers to the concept of black as an abstraction, and the lack
          of aesthetic investigation of this idea in terms of abstraction. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Tell me about the <em>"End-or-fin" </em> (1997)
            project at the Johannesburg Biennial? It looks like not only a site-specific,
            but also even more a debate-specific intervention. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">This was a project selected by Okwui Enwezor, curator of the 2 nd
          Johannesburg Biennale.  He specifically chose that piece, because
          for him it represented the condition of the black male in South Africa
          at that time, which was the condition of existing as a living target.  I
          wanted to portray an image of a man caught in the "rapture" of death
          throes - a dancing death image (end-or-fin = endorphin).  The
          man pictured in the image is that of the great dancer, Bill T. Jones. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong><em>"Halfway" </em> (2001) is more like an
            installation dealing with urbanism. This installation-work seems
            to be one of the ongoing paths in your oeuvre. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes, this was a constructed house that was a metaphoric replica of
          the type visible throughout the Nigerian landscape I was traveling
          through during the summer of 2001.  Buildings half completed
          then abandoned due to a loss of funds, or interest.  This was
          a very typical, upsetting and sad sight.  And it is very reflective
          of the economic and social conditions of the country at this time. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>In one of the installation views I see a construction with
            bricks - explain this to me? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">The piece you are referring to is titled, <em>"House and Home," </em> (2002)
          made for my one-person exhibition at the Miami Art Museum in 2002 as
          part of their 'New Works' series.  It is an extension of the
          ideas in "Halfway", but I wanted to also include the judgment powers
          of the viewer in that the viewer can decide for himself or herself
          if this construction is a building-up, or a tearing-down. And comparatively,
          taking the state and condition of Nigeria as an example, one might
          see this country as a place that is in its process of building itself
          up to being healthy and independent, or in the reverse, to see it as
          a place in perpetual breakdown. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Can you explain what kind of work you will create for the
            Matrix Art Project exhibition? Your show is entitled, " Resistance
            ." Tell me about the conceptualization of the project. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">I plan to work with the word " Resistance " as an idea that exists
          as double negative:  First, I plan to examine what it means for
          someone like myself in this world to show resistance to social constructs
          and cultural attitudes that dehabilitate and confuse.  On the
          inverse, when communicating with art, one needs to understand the opposite
          of being resistant, and engage more so in a state of "submission," of
          being able to submit to a foreign body (the work of art) to begin to
          understand and engage with it.  Beauty can be an active element
          within this process. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>You work with different media/surfaces. What is the relationship
            between them? How do you define the relationship between the works
            that operate in a more conceptual, direct discursive way (like some
            of the installations), the "abstract" paintings, and the figurative
            drawings? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">I see these elements as working hand-in-hand.  Whether it is
          bringing together various media, and/or abstraction with figuration,
          I use these means as a way of opening up and helping to shape the contexts
          into which I want the work to be seen.  From the very beginning,
          I saw this as a very necessary aspect to my project as art viewers
          today can very quickly reduce and consume information into minute and
          generalized bits without getting to any concrete, specific, and in
          turn, complex issues.  And along with common prejudices and misunderstandings
          of abstract painting (primarily of its history), it was my imperative
          to make sure my project would be seen clearly by it not being confused
          with other work being done now, or work that has been done in the past. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Could you tell me more about the spatial scope of your painting,
            both within the painting as a surface (from inaccessible flatness
            towards landscape-like perspectives), and outside as an object (on
            canvas), a spatial element (wall-painting), or the moment it is juxtaposed
            to other objects forming an installation. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">I am not so interested in the minimalist/formalist concern of painting
          as an object, nor the conceptualist concern of painting as a commodity,
          rather, I am interested in painting as a signifier to culture - as
          a cultural space with a cultural history - and not as a representation
          of a single culture, but of several blended and fused together.  Painting
          exists in many forms and formats - I want to keep myself open to this
          possible blending, while at the same time knowing and understanding
          the distinct, respective nature of each of these forms/formats. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Do we deal with the perversion of self - referentiality? With
            post-painterly abstraction necessarily accepting a lot of contextual
            references (in each painting there is also the representation of
            an idea about painting), you are blurring the contradiction between
            abstract and representational painting. At the same time you also
            create an ambiguity around the idea of the "cultural informing" image
            by combining your discursive work with abstract paintings. It is
            real, but it is an image, and vice versa. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes.  And as you say, it is also a fantasy of sorts.  The
          dream, or desire for place and being always tenuously in grasp. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>The impossibility to contemplate in more recent works has
            changed (in some of the earlier hard-edge abstract works one seems
            to be kept out of the pictorial space). Why has that changed? Could
            you describe that evolution of paintings that are closed upon themselves
            (when considering space) towards paintings that seem to become landscapes?
            What happened?  </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">This is a very interesting question to me.  In the early paintings
          I was trying to create a field that was only complete when and until
          the viewer stepped into the space in front of the painting/picture.  Only
          at this moment could the painting be complete as a picture, which was
          in my mind that of a picture of a person looking into a cultural vista,
          a space, a sublime, an Other.  This in turn made this painted
          space real (for instance the sound of a falling tree in a forest that
          goes unheard until it is heard).  The impenetrability you describe
          was the impenetrability of cinema, the picture, and the image.  This
          is something that I have been fascinated with since I could begin to
          look at and understand pictures. One does not penetrate an image, it
          penetrates you - like a slogan, or propaganda.  Let us remember
          that all these visual materials are culturally grounded, and it is
          important to recognize from where their meaning is derived. The landscape
          issue you bring up is my play with the idea of space within the painting
          as pictorial and referential. Ultimately, for me the formalist idea
          of abstraction does not exist. Even a straight horizontal line existing
          as the only element in a canvas can connote the horizon line of a landscape
          that we can easily see anywhere when looking out into space.  I
          enjoy the play of ambiguity between these two points, but in my mind,
          the fusion of abstraction and figuration that I understand brings this
          dichotomy to a nil point. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Also the titles seem to create some ambiguity around representation/abstraction... </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">The titles are used as keys into the pictures I make, but my paintings
          also hopefully have many doors, and many other entrances for the viewer
          to get inside. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>There is a sense of ambiguity regarding time evolving over
            the works. Evacuated by collapsing depth, the notion of time comes
            back in contradictory moves in more recent work. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">In the early days of working on my project, time was experienced more
          as an instant, almost graphically like a photograph, but now I enjoy
          experiencing time in my painting as a window into a deep space, not
          so much pictorial as much as virtual. And I see this space like an
          onion, unraveling as layers, and like boards in a video game, advancing
          from one plane of consciousness to the next. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>By your reception of abstraction as a decoration, you deliberately
            deny a utopian scope. In combination with your more political conceptual
            works this starts to function as a diagnosis of a state of affairs
            where viewers are kept out in the same time. Is there no promise
            of participation here? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Of course, there is no one way for everyone to think, speak and live
          alike, but I do understand decoration as embellishment, as power, and
          of the cultural connectivity of this force called the "decorative," however
          enacted, and in whichever culture it is enacted.  This is how
          I believe we can participate - in accepting the force of others and
          respecting this alongside our own. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Is deconstruction of myths ("modernist painting," "the black
            body") a valid interpretation of your work? I got the impression
            that it reflects more on the possibilities of holding things together.
            It seems that through the negotiation of the traditional pictorial
            rectangle and its overflow or displacement, "painting" as a tradition
            connected to a symbolic field of culture has been permanently at
            the horizon as a desire. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">If I understand you correctly, then I say yes, that painting in effect
          holds the desire of the maker, and reflects the desire of the viewer.  I
          have tried to open up my painting project to also include the desires
          of a specific time (modernism/modernity), and show both its failure,
          as well as a way out of this failure. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>I would not like to call your art a hybrid or a fusion because
            it would move interpretation of your work towards a deconstructive
            analysis in order to define its sources. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">(Laughs). Too late, but yes, I particularly do not like the application
          of the term, "hybrid"  - it simply sounds too horrific, like
          some indescribable atrocity from a horror film. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Could you extend on the notion of dealing with memory and
            the nostalgia for a lost past in your work? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">This is essentially coming from my being raised in America after my
          family fled Nigeria before the start of the Biafrian War.  It
          is difficult to accept that you might have lived a different life in
          a different place had it not been for something as drastic as war that
          can change a person's life completely.  I pose reflections on
          this issue in one way through the creation and depiction of landscape-like
          settings, and through the use of colors to trigger these feelings of
          remoteness, of distance, and of desire for another place of being. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>I would rather look at the arrival of meaning than to its
            origins.  What do you think about the very problematic and
            conflicting use of appropriation in the actual (globalized) art world?
            You use African visual tropes in your imagery among a lot of other
            elements. How can you engage in a conversation between different
            artistic traditions without merely deconstructing symbolic fields
            on the one hand, and accumulating cultural symbolic capital on the
            other? How do you go beyond this instrumentalization of the cultural? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes, the arrival of meaning - this is energy, enlightenment if you
          will, in that one has discovered something in and outside of one's
          self.  And again, you bring up a very distinct and interesting
          point in the appropriation of cultural visual tropes.  For instance,
          I think of Yinka Shonibare as a sophisticated intellectual, and I think
          of Chris Ofili as the great pragmatist as businessman.  To be
          able to utilize one's own cultural signs without objectifying and commodifying
          - to get to central and complex issues through these means is a very
          difficult venture.  How does one do this without pandering to
          cultural prejudices and stereotypes that exist as part and parcel of
          this inquiry?  One has to be very sophisticated and skillful
          as are both Shonibare and Ofili, but to what end do you bring this
          conversation? </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Following this question around the problematic of appropriation,
            I would like to delve into the idea of "ready-made culture," and
            the appropriation of identity. What could be the differences between
            European cultural experience and that of America? Where does Africa
            situate itself in this mental geography? Where does cultural significance
            arrive now that all positions are received aesthetically, rather
            than in terms of some kind of truth-claim? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Let me first begin by saying that I feel that Africa has a closer
          intellectual relationship with Europe than with America.  I see
          this primarily through the relations that where created and maintained
          through colonialism.  In the aspect of "ready-made culture," this
          is a global phenomenon, and not so much owned directly by either America,
          or Europe.  Desire within the African for the modern world and
          all its clich&eacute;s comes from the media control that originates
          from the west.  Whether it is Mercedes Benz or Michael Jackson,
          the effects of both on the African mind is the same - the general African
          would want more of this stuff to take them out of the somewhat dire
          conditions that she or he may be experiencing. No one is solely to
          blame; rather everyone is to blame. Cultural significance is necessary
          in that it helps to define our difference and to make these differences
          interesting.  The real problem arises when they are used to define
          overall, and absolute truths, and in-turn, impose a restriction on
          life. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>What possibilities are there for artistic positions now that
            they are recognized as fictions? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Is this really a problem (fictions)?  If one is to understand
          history as a string of fictions that has only benefit those few in
          power - to add onto this is very problematic.  But if we are
          to engage in possibility and potential within aesthetics, then it could
          be very beneficial to employ fiction in its various conditions. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>In the contemporary art world it sometimes
            seems that there is a deeply rooted mistrust towards images that
            are not easy to translate into another language. Language has led
            to a lot of projects "beyond
            art," and contextualized within an "extended" notion of culture that
            demands from visual arts to "communicate" next to documents such
            as television and other "media," symptomatically displacing the artistic
            question of the visual with the question of visibility. </strong><strong>Since
            some exhibitions are not conceived anymore as exhibitions in the
            strict sense of the term, their intentional space is more and more
            formulated by the terminology of social sciences, as the site where "knowledge
            is produced," or which is "inhabited by interdisciplinarity." Certainly
            in the supposed "globalized" art world, the commodification of the
            so-called "other," occurs when the visual becomes a sign in a narrative
            (as in an anthropological exhibition), and reveals the so-called "correct" stories
            and loaded images with a political surplus value that would maintain
            a subordinate position in a power relationship. This seems to be
            the only way to deal with a population of artists from culturally
            different backgrounds. And this all may seem very normal now, as
            we are already used to these characterizations, but what is not evident
            is the easiness by which these legitimations throw overboard that
            which constitutes an "art exhibition." </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes, see DOCUMENTA XI.  This exhibition, I think, will be seen
          as a very important pivot in the idea, and examination of "art exhibitions."  We
          have to begin to realize that verbal discourse/texts are but one way
          to engage with an artwork, but it is not, nor should it be taken as
          the definitive way to do so. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>When considering your carefully installed shows, like for
            example, <em>"The Invisible Empire," </em> it seems
            that you believe in the art-exhibition as a possible device where
            meaning is not produced, but where it arrives, where it reveals itself
            without making judgments. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes, exactly! I believe in raising questions and being motivated by
          the thoughts generated from them.  This is what I am trying to
          do in the exhibition space. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Instead of a "culture of display," you seem to favor a zone
            where interaction, immobility, the placement of the spectators body,
            focus on the object, and dialectics between the different concrete
            artworks act as key-elements. Abstraction resists instrumentalization
            even though issues are addressed. And a point of view seems to be
            formulated, which one cannot escape (I think here of the work titled, <em>"Cut
            Out," </em> (1999) which looks like a circle from
            a torch that projects a black light beam). </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes, in essence, I am curating myself, and in the process, I am raising
          questions and constructing ideas within an exhibition space. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Once "culture" stood for "the best that was ever thought and
            said in world history," to say it with the words of the English critic
            Matthew Arnold. Of course, this sounds absurd now, to engage an implicit
            western superiority complex in combination with the idea of human
            development, education, and emancipation. This notion of culture
            has been exposed as a veiled euro-centrism, and a form of cultural
            imperialism. Cultural relativism and the construction of the so-called
            multicultural society disgraced this definition of culture. Culture
            is no longer thought of as transmission, education and spiritual
            development, rather it is seen in terms of conflict, power, and the
            accumulation of symbolical capital. </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">Yes, and I feel this becomes so when understanding "culture" as a
          word, or an idea in the singular. By its nature, and in the best sense,
          I see this word as being able to exist in an open and plural state. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>In the same transition, "Fine Arts" and "Culture" divorced.
            This provoked an excessive solidarity with the subordinate position
            as the driving force of emancipatory forces in art and culture against
            the logic of instrumental reason and the seduction of consumer society.
            Under pressure of mass media and technological evolution, boundaries
            between high and low culture disappear and technology infiltrates
            the arts. The impact of leisure culture and market-economic thinking
            in the sector of the arts forced some artists to take up ever sharper
            and more marginal positions. So, the fact that a lot of art indeed
            wants to address different social and political problems in contemporary
            society, and for doing so wants to function as a direct and pure
            means of communication, that on top of that aims at producing a direct
            effect, is in the best case na&iuml;ve (the art institution sharpens
            its frame because otherwise these acts would be invisible), and in
            the worst case is counter-productive, because a number of these practices
            arrived in the art-world because they were not able to find another
            public. What do you think in this context of the "knowingly gratuitousness" (art
            is not essentially the answer to a question, or the solution to a
            presented problem) that Michael Fried characterized contemporary
            art with? And what do you think is the place and effectiveness of
            art? </strong></p>
        <p class="style1">I could agree with Michael Fried, but certainly not from the same
          theoretical platform.  I believe that it is pretentious of art
          to think that it can solve our social problems like dictators and politicians
          think they can solve our social problems.  Rather, it has in
          it the power to bring together a collective.  And as such, the
          power regimes within our world structure create the situations we have
          where this potential collective will never be able to band together
          and exist as a functioning body. Whether this is executed through divisive
          notions of nationalism, race, gender, religious faith, class, history,
          etc., there will continue to be distractions set up against this idea
          of the collective body.  Art can only successfully bring to attention
          the infinite questions that we ask as human beings.  It is up
          to us all as thinking people to be able to find and communicate, with
          respect to the full potential of our humanity, the possibilities of
          what can exist hereafter. </p>
