          <img src="sorcerer.jpg" width="386" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">In 
          his essays, "Six Memos for the Next Millennium,' Italo Calvino 
          distilled five characteristics whose qualities he considered the most 
          difficult for the creative imagination to achieve: lightness, quickness, 
          exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity. These attributes are now hallmarks 
          of the world of cyberspace, the everyday virtual worlds of the cool 
          blue screen. The weight of the world, its opacfty, is transformed into 
          a weightless, abstract visual lightness that has acquired emblematic 
          value. By recognizing and playing upon the paradoxical nature of virtual 
          reality's transmutations, Odili Donald Odita embeds in the materiality 
          of painting a sense of the oscillating, interwoven spaces and narratives 
          moving at light-fling speed through cyberspace. <br>
          <br>
          Odita, born in Nigeria and raised in Ohio, integrates many different 
          idioms, drawing from art history, digital technology, traditional African 
          art, contemporary discourse, and personal narrative. His recent concurrent 
          exhibitions at Florence Lynch Gallery, featuring intimately scaled paintings 
          and drawings, and at Riva Gallery, featuring large scale paintings and 
          mixed media installations, evince a nuanced and sensuous abstract pictorial 
          language and an ability to move fluidly between perceptual and conceptual 
          concerns, discursive spaces and visceral responses.<br>
          <br>
          The aesthetic impact of Odita's outsized (80 x 104 inches) acrylic paintings 
          at Riva Gallery was one of being surrounded by sheer beauty and luminous 
          effervescence. Meticulously structured and multi-tiered horizontal zigzagging 
          planes pulsate in syncopated rhythms across the canvas, edging toward 
          extending outward into space. Odita deploys sophisticated formal means 
          to suggest a liminal dimension between states, a phase transition, precipitously 
          sliding toward vibration. An incipient illusionism taps into elusive 
          references that appear to float on a wei9htless planar translucency.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="descent.jpg" width="364" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right"> 
          "Descent' (2001) merges cool, low key blue and green scissoring 
          planes with sandwiched layers of warm, high key oranges, reds, and pinks. 
          Sliced pyramidal forms are mirrored by shadowed inversions and overlaps, 
          illusionistic in their optical play, animating a surface skin which 
          cannot be contained by a gestalt experience. While the destabilization 
          of perception by Color Field painting and Op art are referenced by Odita, 
          his intuitive abstraction is multivalent, infiltrated by suggestions 
          of landscape terrain or atmosphere, flickering computer or T.V. screens, 
          textile traditions or fragmented architectonic spaces. Informed by the 
          circulation of Euro-American modernism and its attendant appropriation 
          of African cultural influences, paintings such as "Horizon' (2001) 
          and 'Over Here, Over There' (2001) are redolent not with a fashionable 
          irony but with a vital sense of an emerging vernacular which engages 
          memory, loss, hope and the possibility of creating new idioms from a 
          genuine cultural pluralism.<br>
          <br>
          Odita's expansive paintings affect the nature of the viewer's bodily 
          experience of space and form via subtly crafted color modulations and 
          dynamics of tone, evoking a kind of synesthetic experience akin to "seeing' 
          music. Jazz and, in particular, the music of Miles Davis are never far 
          from Odita's frame of references. He structures visual fugue-like compositions: 
          layers of rhythmically repeated but slyly variant voices, a complex 
          polyphony with a dissonant edge, containing contiguities and variations 
          on a theme.<br>
          Interspersed with the paintings, Odita's three concise mixed media installations, 
          "Family Tree,' 'Heaven Can Wait,' and 'Half Way,' engage discursive 
          and conceptual issues raised by his transatiantic American and African 
          experiences. The artist's father is an art historian, painter and professor, 
          and thus, Odita grew up surrounded by art books and art conversation, 
          the ongoing processes of painting and his father's collection of African 
          artifacts. His parents imparted their heritage of a living lgbo culture 
          in its specificity, dovetailed with commonalities within a larger African 
          cultural framework. T<img src="boy.jpg" width="225" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">he 
          related installations grew from a period (1994-1997) when Odita had 
          stopped painting to focus on conceptual mixed media work. More recently, 
          these installations have become highly metaphoric: lyric condensations 
          of experiences, clues and fragments, slices of the familiar made strange. 
          "Family Tree' employs an enlarged Warholian film-strip format to 
          vertically juxtapose burnished black-and-red images of ceremonial masks 
          from the artist's ethnic heritage paired with documentary style, dose-up 
          photo-portraits of individuals. This doubling strategy developed during 
          his recent travels in Nigeria, when Odita was struck by the uncanny 
          similarity of facial features between certain ceremonial masks and passersby 
          living in areas where the masks were made. The artist critically recontextualizes 
          the standard art history "visual comparison" methodology (double 
          slide carousel presentations) with modernist notions of African masks 
          as anonymous, depersonalized and stylzed aesthetic objects. Odita inverts 
          these conventions by offering a personalized "Family Tree' of masks 
          which clearly portray individuals from the community. His inversion 
          inheres an elegiac pitch to the photo-based project.<br>
          <br>
          The directness and spontaneity of the smaller drawings on paper and 
          paintings featured at Florence Lynch Gallery disclose emotions and felt 
          experience of a personal and political nature brought dose to the surface. 
          In his figurative and gestural charcoal and tempera works, such as "Boy' 
          (2001), 'Soldier' (2001) or 'Burning' 2001, the artist's intellectualization 
          and conceptual distance are kept at a minimum, deferring to contingent 
          and immediately expressive means. The Nok Figures #1, #2, and #3 are 
          a face-off to the genre of Western portraiture as it relates to African 
          masks used as invigorating modernist tools by Picasso, Matisse, and 
          the German Expressionists. These figurative works on paper have a spare 
          sophistication of form and technique which carry an emotional weight 
          and a sense of vulnerability or precariousness.<br>
          <br>
          Odita's work in various media consistently display a precise presence 
          and invoke the poetic or lyric mode. That is to say, he is concerned 
          with the metaphysical dimensions of the concrete world. The transcendent 
          as well as the virtual figure in his work, as does the power of beauty.</font></p>
