          Color Theory was the title of Odili Donald Odita's first New York solo 
          exhibition held at Florence Lynch Gallery from October 16 to November14. 
          New paintings, mixed media works and digitally manipulated photographs 
          investigated the relationship between aesthetic traditions and cultural 
          codes through the language of colors. <img src="colortheory2.jpg" width="420" height="289" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">Born 
            in Enugu, Nigeria, and brought to America by his parents when he was 
            only six months old, right after the Biafran war, Odita was raised in 
            the Midwest assimilating important aspects of postmodern America, its 
            myths and cultural languages, from art to the movies and advertising. 
            With an educated African background, he came to live through the tension 
            and psychological devastation of being reduced to being black in a country 
            that defines identity according to race. The artist's strong sense of 
            Nigerian identity was kept alive by family traditions, through stories 
            told by his parents. in the collection of African art and artifacts 
            in his home, and through a constant reminding of his roots. With an 
            art historian for a father, Odita grew up reflecting upon two separate 
            layers of aesthetic understanding, one academic, the other instinctive, 
            one intrinsic in his birth language and roots, the other adopted and 
            learned through everyday culture, forming the relationship between ideology 
            of aesthetics and identity of space, which would become an important 
            aspect of his work. Racial and ethnic codes were fundamental signifiers 
            for the artist's perception of identity, intensified by a massive and 
            growing distribution and generalization of these codes throughout media-cultures.<br>
          <br>
          Odita's work took an important turn when he moved to New York in the 
          early 1990s. The intensity of the city's fast-paced energy, its hypnotic 
          architecture of the spectacle with lights and giant billboards, with 
          mobile ads passing by on buses or through the trends of people, did 
          not spare any one from its gaze. The city of many cultures crammed together 
          was able to keep each culture distinct in language and tradition. The 
          assimilation of this separateness shared into the same space. or the 
          conceiving of different but integrated spaces, or even a hybridization 
          of the image are perhaps the most important aspects of his work. Its 
          process and concept combine a variety of tendencies, sometimes contradictory 
          sometimes complementary, such as the warmth and openness of his African 
          palette in contrast to the striking colors of American-suburbia represented 
          in his paintings, or the distance and precision of more reductive structural 
          patterns in contrast to his fascination with light and space whether 
          physical or mental, whether through the rendering of repetitive diagonal 
          lines, or in the multi-layers of meaning implied in the more conceptual 
          aspect of his work.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="blackasanegativespace.jpg" width="270" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">"Black 
            as a Negative Space," (1997-99), is a digitally manipulated photograph 
            of a typical fashion magazine scene with three models posing for a shot. 
            The picture also depicts a black silhouette, which stands out in relation 
            to the soft background. The cutout or negative space of the photo, here 
            scanned into a much larger size, reflects the influences of advertising 
            and commerce. of cut and paste strategies in the substituting and selling 
            of cultural information, and the obliteration of a "negative" 
          identity, the identity of the other. The pattern, represented by repetitive 
          codes such as the similarities in the appearance of the models, or other 
          strategies of control is one of the many hegemonic schemes utilized 
          by advertising to promote a simplification in our comprehension of identity. 
          Most recently, the advertising industries have produced a more heterogeneous 
          set of codes, mixing different races and ethnicities in a trendy and 
          appealing look. Although New York's giant billboards promote a growing 
          cross-cultural diversity, is this really a sign of an empirical support 
          for multi-culturalism in the States, or is it part of a greater campaign, 
          the one that spreads Western codes throughout the world? The negative 
          or altered space of Odita's piece is the one whose identity is not represented 
          here, the outer edge of a group, the periphery.<img src="thewhiteissue.jpg" width="231" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right"> A similar idea although focusing more on the confrontation with the 
            viewer is the work entitled "The White Issue," (1997-99). 
            Made in a similar fashion of the former, "The White Issue" 
          depicts the front cover of Vogue, with a model in front of a landscape 
          which colors could be reminiscent of the reddish-brown tones of African 
          soil. Here, the artist continues to emphasize the metaphors schemed 
          by consumerism inviting the viewer to reflect upon its aesthetic and 
          illusive aspect, the opulence of visual satisfaction of other lands 
          and other realities camouflaged by the luscious artifices of advertising. 
          The frightening aspect implied by Odita's work is not only the inculcating 
          of unimaginative aesthetic codes by the fashion industry, but the apathy 
          of the viewer in their assimilation and consumption. To be allured by 
          these codes is also to endure a voyeuristic act of admiration for the 
          altered image represented by a pattern. This alienation and generalization 
          of sexuality disguised through the language of fashion and hegemonically 
          articulated through the advertising industry is not lesser a strategy 
          of manipulation and control over individual sexuality than the pornographic 
          industry's images. It also forms a clear link between sexual nihilism 
          and porn's billion dollar economy.<br>
          <br>
          Odita's paintings depicting diagonal layers of vivid colors such as 
          "Present Tense," "The Speed of Life," "Pan-Am," 
          and "Open," all from 1999, deal with more than just structure 
            and rhythm. <img src="pan-am.jpg" width="363" height="320" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">They 
            represent the aesthetic struggle between form and concept; or more specifically, 
            the dynamics of the aesthetic process against the immediate influences 
            of the psycho-social. These layers of colorful bliss are the bright 
            lights of the spectacle translated into space. Odita's paintings contain 
            contradictions in relation to more conceptual works, among them "The 
            White Issue" and "Black as a Negative Space." The paintings 
            have a feminine, almost lyrical quality evoked by the horizontal lines, 
            and a distance from the concept, although this is clearly present in 
            the limits of each color. The layers as conductors of color and light 
            cross the canvas on a continuous flow, in a decentralized web of possibilities 
            separated only by space. In these paintings, Odili Donald Odita permeates 
            an opening experience of escape and laughter, a trance into colors and 
        space.</font></p>
